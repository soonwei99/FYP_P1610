0,Alysa B.,Opium,"My boyfriend and I came in one afternoon expecting basic cocktails, what we received was an amazing, personalized drinking experience with Laine. We were the only ones sitting at the bar which may be why we were able to receive the attention we got but it was easily the best service and experience I've had at a bar.

I started with the Red Moon which was sooooo delicious and refreshing with vodka and watermelon; while my boyfriend had a gin martini. After our first round, we asked Laine for recommendations. She recommended something to each of us based on our palette. I had the 50 shades of grey cocktail which was delicious and also so much fun to watch being made!

Laine told us so much about herself and the owner of the restaurant who also owns a few other places on the street (all known to be the best in KL). Our experience was sooo amazing and I can't wait to find myself back in KL to come back!"
0,Cyrus A.,Opium,"This restaurant was absolutely fantastic, it's an excellent choice if you're looking for a fancy meal at a relatively affordable price. My friend and I split a noodle dish and two entrees, as well as a fancy cocktail each, all for around $75 total.

The place is a little noisy, and definitely in a touristy/fratty part of town. But once we were seated, we had outstanding service and really enjoyed the experience. Our server was very helpful, and made great suggestions about the various options on the menu.

We started with crispy noodles and fried prawns, which were delicious. The noodles come in a great broth, and the prawns are lightly battered, crispy to perfection.

For our mains, we split a beef dish that we ate on soft buns. It was spicy without being overpowering, and the flavors were unreal. After the buns ran out, I was eating straight from the bowl! We also got a duck dish with rice. The duck was tender and juicy, with a sweet flavor and lots of delicious veggies included in the dish.

I would definitely recommend this place as a dinner destination during even a short stay in Kuala Lumpur!"
0,Louise A.,Opium,"Celebrated my birthday here and so were two more persons cuz they started sing for them. Yeah whatever, I think this place was really good. The environment was hipster and a little retro. There was a girl sitting and playing some kind of piano very beautifly, and the mood was great!
I ate some dumplings with black pepper and prawns, delicious, and my man took some noodles, they were really good too. The drinks had a twist and they were served in special cups, fun! Over all a great place for a birthday dinner, some drinks with your friends or a dejt. But I think the kids should be left home. Not that kind of place..."
0,Bob V.,Opium,"By the reviews I was anticipating a wow & I got excellent service along with mediocre food. I started with the Fighting Cock Wings w/habenero. Soggy & mild flovor,
right out of the microwave.  Rather disappointing, as i was here for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening 6:30pm. Lets see if the main course is any better? Yes the lemon orange chicken was better but I would not return with much better options out there!
Not worth the price."
0,Neil M.,Opium,"Loved everything about Opium! Service, food, music were all great. Food was very unique and special with decent portions.

Highly recommend for the price. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place is hard to beat for $$."
0,Cindy C.,Opium,very nice restaurant and bar. meals were tasty cocktail was super special. we enjoyed it very much. live music was a girl play Chinese pipa. price is a but expensive.about $150 per person. will go back if get chance.
0,Bartholomew B.,Opium,"My first time to KL and asked the hotel concierge for the best local restaurant - they were spot on. This place is amazing and unique. The food was superb, the drinks were the most artistic and delicious I've received to date. The 4 spirits drinks are so cool - I had Earth and Water on 2 different days. I also had a draft beer, which they serve in a bowl - was odd at first but kind of made me feel like a cat. The staff were sweet and quick. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're unsure where to go."
0,Lucie B.,Opium,"Went here for the all you can eat DIM SUM lunch and it was awesome, 28RM for as many plates of dim sum, noodles and other dishes and all was of great quality and taste.

I also just love the decor here, it truly feels like you have stepped into a time warp. They play great lounge music and the furnishings are gorgeous. Definitely still 5 stars in my book."
0,LeEllen L.,Opium,"Amazing food and wonderful service. :) I really enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere, the music and the lighting, it was a delightful and delicious evening."
0,John W.,Opium,"It's ok. Food is good but not great. Cocktails are the same... not the worst but certainly not cocktail bar standards. People there are friendly though! Good service. I wouldn't return since there are clearly way better options around. But if I was forced to go, I would not be too upset."
0,Björn K.,Opium,"Seriously delicious food, friendly staff helping you out with what goes with what and even how to eat it, Watch out for the deep fried chillies, they're mortal!
Had some dumplings (super yummy), some quinoa (even more yummy) and a desert with sago (sweeeeet)!!!"
0,Jim D.,Opium,Been twice now.  The lunch set is tasty and good value for money.  The regular menu is...  Expensive for what you get.
0,Catherine S.,Opium,My friend and I had a great meal here. Most authentic Asian meal I've tasted but I'm no expert. We had  main noodle dishes and dim sum. Very flavorable. The service was top notch.
0,Wen H.,Opium,"Something that caught my eyes in Changkat due to the vintage Chinese ambience at the corner of Changkat road, we went in to have our dinner. Opium is a bar cum restaurant with a Chinese theme. The decoration is worth a visit to this restaurant. It is also very famous for its cocktails. We ordered Ti-Lung Bramble and Red Lantern Margarita. All their cocktails are served in wooden tray accompanied with 2 different type of nuts.

For main course, we ordered the Crispy Duck Noodles with crispy yee mee noodles served over a rich brown sauce and topped with a smoked duck slices. Another main dish that we ordered is the eye catching Opium Black Fried rice. It is very delicious and very flavorful. The black fried rice comes from squid ink.

Overall the food is delicious however the pricing is a tad bit more on the expensive side. Worth the try."
0,Jonathan S.,Opium,"Ordered the beef rendang, thought it was overpriced until I realized just how much meat they'd given me. And the service was impeccable. Highly recommend"
0,Lars S.,Opium,The salmon Noodle was awesome. The 5 seasoning duck as well. The beef dishes however did not meet our expectations. But beef is always a gamble in aisia if you ask me. Very friendly staff by the name of Marvin.
0,Shandos C.,Opium,"Gorgeous little cocktail bar and restaurant with lots of atmosphere. Most of the bars along this busy strip had screens showing the football, which we decided to skip, in favour of this bar on the corner, which initially had a live musician playing traditional music. The cocktails are fantastic, especially the presentation. However, they were the most expensive drinks we had when visiting Malaysia - about 40 ringgit once tax & service was added ($13 AUD, not much less than I'd pay in Sydney bars)."
0,Ross H.,Opium,Our favorite meal in KL.  Very creative cocktails and solid food.  I highly recommend the wings.  Great atmosphere and service.
0,Peter L.,Opium,"Opium KL has been open only since last year, but it already feels like a fixture in Bukit Bintang and for good reason.  Start with a beautiful  space at a prime corner location, good food and cocktails and a cheerful staff, it's a great place to relax and enjoy.  The retro Chinese décor is inviting, and there is a patio in addition to some very nice booths and regular tables.  On the past three trips, they also had live music on a traditional Chinese string instrument which also added to the atmosphere.  I really love the cocktails here even though I normally stick to traditional cocktails.  The creativity and presentation is awesome, and I normally start off with an Eastern Aviation, a twist on the Aviation but using cherry liquor instead of crème de violette.  I also love the Shanghailander, a nice balance between peated whiskey and lemon juice.  And the presentation of 50 Shades of Grey is quite creative.  As for the food, it's a mix of local and Chinese food.  The black pepper dumpling was a bit soggy.  Better was the Sugarcane prawns, which were fried nicely.  The black fried rice was also quite good, and I've enjoyed the beef rending, served with buns on 3 occasions.  I've been to KL now 3 times during the past year, and each time, I've ended  up at Opium and for good reason, as they do so many things quite well!"
0,T S.,Opium,Ambiance is stunning. Live music on a Guzheng. Fabulous service. Delicious food. On a busy happening street in the heart of KL. Walking distance from many hotels. A must when in KL.
0,Kevin W.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock Kopitiam is the true 1Malaysia. Just by judging by its name, you can guess that they serve all three Chinese, Malay, Indian cuisine under one roof. To my understanding, they were once were with a famous nasi lemak place in PJ and they branched out to start their own kopitiam.
I'd say the nasi lemak here is actually really good although it is pretty pricey. At the same time, the meehun soto here is quite good too.
The Hainanese chicken rice and chicken chop are really good too.
This place is famous for lunch and to find parking in the area is close to impossible.
Service here is pretty fast as most of the food has a fast preparation time and their nasi lemak is already ready.
Their price is rather reasonable, all about RM10-RM15 there about."
0,Hannah E.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","First breakfast in KL had to be nasi lemak ayam, and I chose to get it here, where they seems very surprised anyone was ordering chicken at 8am. Everyone else in the place was scarfing their sweet egg toasts and milky coffee.

It took them forever to get it out; I think it was the first order of the day. To be fair, they warned me it would take ten minutes, and, well, my bad for forgetting what southeast Asians mean by ten minutes (35 minutes). But when it came out, it was worth it. Scorching hot freshly fried tender chicken pieces, tiny fish, peanuts, and a pile of deep red savory spicy sambal to mix it with the saturated coconut rice. Just a very satisfying mix.

Topped off by an excellent barley milk tea which was the first non-oversugared specimen I'd ever had, I was well fueled to complete a hot day of walking!"
0,Mansa C.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","For the 3rd time I've experienced completely incompetent service. Their staff cannot handle large crowds at all. Food and drinks come randomly and one friend waited more than 40 minutes before his food showed up, the  rest of us had finished eating at this point. To be honest the food isn't worth the wait.

If there is more than a few people here stay the hell away. Their kitchen can't cope."
0,Muhi L.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",Perfect representation of old school Malaysia. Highly recommend their Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng . Fast and very clean
0,Vanessa O.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","The name of this place is already giving you hint of the cuisines that you can find in Malaysia and yes, it is a mixture of Malay, Indian and Chinese cuisines - 1Malaysia so to speak.  Located near to the Petaling Street, there are plenty of parking spaces available here, but if it is at night, you should be extra careful as that area is slightly notorious - gangs are around that area to seek money if you are looking for parking spaces.

The interior offers a vintage feel where the paints are scrap off - and the partially run down look was one of their main selling point of this kopitiam concept. My favourite is definitely their nasi lemak and it is definitely one of the best that I've ever had so far!

This place is a nice place to hang-out and enjoy local cuisine which is a good place for locals, students as well as tourist to have their meal here. Price? Definitely reasonable!! Go ahead and order the Nasi Lemak here!! Highly recommended"
0,Wai Min K.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","We stumbled upon this kopitiam and really, I'm so glad we did! I was so drawn and attracted by the name of this kopitiam - Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock, which are respectively, very typical Malay, Indian and Chinese names. I really like the setting of this kopitiam - it's a good mix of old and new. And also, they were playing a mix of Malay, Indian and Chinese songs - I thought that was really awesome! Okay, I might have gotten a little bit excited when they played Zee Avi and Zainal Abidin...

Anyway, as for the food - well, we only had the lontong (RM8) and Hainanese chicken chop (RM14). I thought the lontong was okay, but I really enjoyed the Hainese chicken chop! I will definitely be back for more!"
0,Sandra Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","As the name suggests, Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock (AMAH) Kopitiam is definitely a foodstop for all time favourite Malaysian cuisines where you get the famous Malay, the Chinese and Indian foods under one roof. It can be said that this Kopitiam symbolises Malaysian diversity and that our love for food brings us all together. It's situated near the police station and right beside Old China Cafe.

Throughout my meal, they were playing songs sung and composed by Malaysian talents. It's definitely living up to its Malaysian image.

The bowl of lontong I ordered was huge! At least the portion was huge for me. Other than that, the nasi impit (rice cake) wasn't great, it was too tough and the texture was as if it was refrigerated before serving. The sayur lodeh (a coconut based soup) was not bad though, with a generous portion of vegetables. All of these going for RM8 only.

The Hailam Chicken Chop was slightly above mediocre. The juicy chicken chop served with tomato sauce and beans with some fries and sliced vegetables on the side. Sadly, the fries were limp and too salty for my liking. This plate of chicken chop costs RM14.

I would have ordered the Nasi Lemak instead if I knew that AMAH is well-known for it. I guess I'll just have to revisit to try its infamous dish.

Also, AMAH has a branch in Oasis Ara Damansara for those who live around that area."
0,Juan S.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",We ordered the Roti Jala. Comes with chicken curry. Flavor is very aromatic and not too spicy. Kampung Nasi goreng is good. Topped with fried egg. This place is jammed with lunch crowd. Will be back for more. The interior decor is very nice like mama store.
0,Grace Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",We had a rather large breakfast here one morning. Great nasi lemak. We also had the roti with chicken. I have never had these kind of stringy roti before and it was delicious. Highly recommended if you are in for some real Malaysian food.
0,Bathori T.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Came here just for nasi lemak, well it is not as tho, the ayam is crispy and the sauce is tasty"
0,Arnab B.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",They are fabulous. A little difficult to locate at first but man they are amazing. Just try everything on their menu as I was tempted to do but of course you can only eat that much. What a fabulous experience from start to finish. Quaint little gem.
0,Fairuz Z.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","One of the very little known places in Petaling Street area, this kopitiam has it own attractions among backpackers communities. The food obviously, authentic malaysian. Love their roti jala and nasi lemak! I wish they served ABC or Cendol too."
0,Ivan L.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Nasi Lemak is currently listed as one of the healthiest breakfast by Time magazine.
The famous nasi lemak here is a must try, served with fried chicken marinated with herb n spices.

The food 4/5
Environment 4/5
Service 4/5"
0,Eveline L.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock has a branch in Oasis Ara Damansara. It is located just behind Old Town Kopitiam."
0,Jason Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Well known for their Malaysian food, Ali, Muthu, Ah Hock seems like one of those newly hyped Malaysian cuisine restaurant. After all, how many places are able to actually produce good Malaysian food right? I tried it to see how well they could amaze my tastebuds and boy was I not disappointed. Their Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng is definitely not overrated over here and is really good. As a fan of nasi  lemak, I've tried many places and I must say this is one of the really good ones. Chicken is hot and freshly fried but not overcooked so its still really juicy with crispy chicken skin. I also tried the kerang curry which is cockles in curry and it was alright although the cockles wasnt quite as big and juicy as i wouldve liked. Prices here are slightly on the high side for Malaysian food with an average of Rm10 and above so not the cheapest place to eat but its definitely worth a try."
0,Louis H.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Authentic flavor, guaranteed not to be able to found else where.

You just got to try the soup noodle, and the chicken chop. Will not be disappointed. It's cheap yet astounding flavored!

Shop is abit old but it's part of the culture."
0,Andrew B.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"We ate here as a family of four speaking no Malay at all and was pleasantly surprised. Staff were helpful and food was good.
Had a variety of different dishes that included Chinese rice, quail, garlic naan and roti. Kids can be picky but they enjoyed this also.
Lucky we got in about 6:30 as by 7:30 the place was full
Would eat here again, whole meal and four drinks only came to about $35r"
0,Jasmine C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It's my first time at the new place and despite the difficulty in parking nearby, I'm liking the new place. A lot more spacious and brighter.

Service was very quick, with menus passed to us as soon as we sat down. We also didn't have to wait too long for the food to be served. Had the Hainanese pork chop and when it came, the portion was very decent and I found it quite tasty. Not as dry as I worried it would be.

The Lum Mee was also not bad, a bit bland to start but easily remedied with black vinegar. I also have fond memories of this place's roti babi and marble cake. All in all, a nice walk down memory lane when dining here."
0,Shuen P.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee is a restaurant that serves traditional Hailam style breakfast and lunch. I use to work nearby and Yut Kee is one of my favourite lunch time places. I start off with their classic famous chicken chop, pork chop, roti babi, hokkien mee, Cantonese style noodles, fish porridge, noodle soup and many others until I tried their belacan fried rice. I'm a very loyal person, once I'm into something, I'll always order the same dish. Belacan fried rice is my favourite dish in Yut Kee and my drink will always be their barley lime. Most people are purposely there on Friday for their ""famous"" roasted pork roll but I find it a little overrated and very overpriced.

Whenever I am there for lunch, I usually take away their kaya roll to snack on during tea time. Most people prefer their butter cake but I'm more into their kaya roll.
Other than lunch, sometimes I am there early in the morning before work for their breakfast too. Usually I will have their traditional half boiled eggs with steamed bread sometimes their fish porridge. A good day always starts with good breakfast."
0,Jay Sern C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Roasted pork, roti Babi (pork bread), pork chop, Hainanese noodle and toast bread are good!

Service is good too!

Prepare to wait for 15-30min

Highly recommended!"
0,Penny W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee is definitely one of the oldest operating Hailam restaurants in town. It doesn't only offer main course meals but cakes too. I went there around 11 am and it is almost full house, nonetheless we managed to get a spot. After our food is served, people started waiting outside of the restaurant already. There are many chairs available to sit while waiting for your turn. So I advice you be early, if you want to eat there!

I got to try fish and chips, pork chop and chicken chop. The portion is definitely worthy for the price! One of the most famous dishes is pork chop but unfortunately, it was disappointing for me. The meat was tough and I had hard time chewing it. For the other two dishes, I quite enjoy it but the fried fish fillet is a tad too oily.

Oh right, I forget to mention that it is very difficult to find parking. There was once, I went almost 5 rounds around the area just to get a parking spot."
0,Eugene L.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"This is probably one of the earliest Hainanese Coffee Shops in Kuala Lumpur, this place is also called ""Jacks"" if I remembered it correctly from my dad. This place is famous for their Kaya Rolls and Marble Cakes (Although lately their quality has been on a decline lately, but it's still nice though).

This place is usually packed during breakfast and lunch hours as it is frequent by people working nearby. Their signature dishes are Belacan Fried Rice, Roti Babi, Hainanese Chicken/pork chops, Pork Roast and fish porridge.

My personal favourite here has got to be their Chicken Chop which I can finish 2 servings by myself (It doesn't mean I'm a glutton, maybe their portion is a little too small?). Other than that, I would say the beauty about having to dine here is actually the environment, it is about the most authentic experience you can find in KL if you're looking for old fashion/vintage Chinese Coffee Shop, This is IT!"
0,Julian O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"I've been coming here for the past 5 years now even when they used to be in the much smaller coffee shop that could barely fit 10 tables. The Hainanese Chicken Chop and Hailam Mee are the clear standouts here - you'll be hard pressed to find either dish in all of KL and both dishes couldn't be executed any better here. The Chicken Chop comes with the most tender chicken thigh ever with a light, delicate brown sauce. The Hailam Mee packs a punch of flavor - salty with the right balance of sweetness. Perfect for a hearty breakfast. Get 2 dishes if you're hungry."
0,Stan N.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Very welcoming and warm service at this eatery. Very patient and friendly wait staff and owner. Came here for the famous Roti Babi and I was not disappointed. The Roti is nicely toasted and it is warm, soft and fluffy. Within it is a nicely seasoned filling of pork (hence Babi) and onions. Wished I could eat more but I also ordered the Hailam Mee which was also good and had a good portion of pork lard! Yums! Must come back for the chicken chop which I noticed comes with a side of toast."
0,Sue F.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"I love this place because of the nostalgia factor. I was a little sad when they moved to their new location last year, but I found the food to be of the same quality. The pork chops were still as good, and the Hailam mee was still slippery and slimy as I remembered it.

My favourite here will always be the marble cake. Typical to Hainanese style cakes, it's oilier than some people are used to but I absolutely devour it every time I make a visit. Amazingly, the owners also managed to keep the setting of the place similar by reusing the furniture they had in the previous lot.

Yut Kee will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope never to see it go."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"The legendary Yut Kee had been moved from the front row shop beside the main road to this shop behind around a year ago, but nothing about the crowd has changed. That's even if you are here at 8 in the morning for breakfast, the crowd is still there, mainly comprised of those who are working nearby.

If you are here during Friday and the weekends, which is when they are serving their infamous pork loin - be here even earlier as their pork loin runs out pretty quickly! That being said, yes - they don't do serve this on the other weekdays, so note this to avoid any disappointment!

Lum mee is another of my repeated order when I'm here. Of course, this would just be my personal preference as the noodles they use to prepare their lum mee here is thicker than the usual lum mee's you would find elsewhere. And, if you are familiar with Yut Kee, you would know about their chicken chop as well - definitely evoke feelings of nostalgia with their sauce and each bite of it.

As they serve pork loin here as their signature dish, you would know that this place is non-halal. So, the next thing that I also like about the place would be their roti babi - a piece of toast coated with egg and heavily buttered and fried to golden brown, wrapping a full load of pulled pork prepared with a lot of onions with it. The owner told me that I should eat it with the L&P sauce, but I personally find it to be equally distinct tasting just on its own too.

Definitely a place that I wouldn't mind waking up early for their breakfast during weekends - a small and old shop with lots of comfort foods!"
0,Chong-Te O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It's hard to find good authentic traditional Malaysian Hainanese food these days, I have been coming to Yut Kee since I was a little boy, the family run business has stood the test of time and still going strong after all these years!!!"
0,Michelle C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"There is plenty of hype surrounding this place and one needs a lot of patience especially since the line is insanely long. When I went there on a Saturday afternoon, my family and I had to wait about an hour and a half to get in. The management has a very reliable waiting list system and there is a sating area for those who are waiting.

the food is good and lives up to its name. It is also very affordable. In my opinion their Lum Mee is one of the best dishes here, as well as their pork chop. Prices are reasonable."
0,Gladys Y.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It was probably billions of years ago that my boyfriend first brought me to this pork chop place. He promised me it was going to be so delicious, and it is. We still go there regularly until now. :)

Previously, this place tried to maintain the essence of Malaysian heritage by not renovating their shop; the yellowish walls, the colourful windows and tiles, and even the antique furniture and cutleries. Eventually as the shop gets more and more famous, it failed to contain the number of visitors especially on weekends; making such a huge queue each time we pay a visit. However, in the end they renovated to a new bigger place now, still maintaining the heritage feel, but way less crowded and more organized. Good job, Yut Kee!

Our favourite dishes at the restaurant (and our staple orders) are the pork chop, kaya French toast, nasi goreng kampung, and we normally ""tapao"" their handmade kaya spread and kaya roll cake too. If you are planning to visit this shop anytime soon, please try these dishes I mentioned; they are seriously tasty that we can never eliminate even one dish each time we visit. ^_^ Price wise, it is not too expensive and totally worth it! My boyfriend and I normally spend around RM 60++ inclusive the foods we packed home. Go go go try if you haven't yet! :)"
0,Rebecca W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee has been around for ages, and they are famous for serving Hainanese cuisine. They have now moved to a new location at Jalan Kamunting in KL, and the place is still packed as usual.

One of the signature dishes is the Hainanese Chicken Chop - fried chicken topped with brown sauce, potatoes and mixed vegetables. The chicken was moist and I like the brown sauce a lot, it's very flavourful. I once tried the Pan Fried Mee Sua, and it was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much, but the mee sua was crispy and you can taste the fragrance of the garlic in it. I tasted very close to the ones my aunty used to make for me when I was young.

They serve some amazing kaya too - rich texture and not too sweet. With their amazing kaya, they serve some nice Kaya Swiss Roll too. The rolls were buttery and light, and the kaya filling was just heavenly.

Yut Kee is really a nice kopitiam to have some authentic Hainanese cuisine at a reasonable price. The downside would probably be the crowd, and the waiting time."
0,Evonne M.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,Not really the best place to get nice food in kl. I don't mind ordering the fried loh mee and skip the rest
0,Julian T.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee has been around for such a long time now and people still crowd this classic place. I often visit during my lunch break from classes and that's when offices are off for lunch too, which makes it very hard to find seats. I usually just decide to park in the open carparks around there, I don't particularly remember which, but look for the ones with per-entry rates.

They are known for their Pork Chop and Bun (Roti Babi). I love the Pork Bun, it's a very greasy delight which you might regret devouring so many of it later. If you prefer non-pork options, they also have a Chicken Chop that tastes just as good. They also have dishes like Belacan Fried Rice and French Toast, which are delicious as well.

For some sweet delights, they are also famous for the Kaya Rolls here, but recently I felt like it doesn't taste as good anymore. Maybe it was just that day, I'll find out when I visit again."
0,Vanessa O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Before this restaurant moved to their own new building, my mom used to stop by her car at the road side to buy us the kaya swiss rolls and those were the days reminiscing my teenage life. Since they have this new building and had made themselves into headlines, the restaurant had garnered enough media attention as well as the public's attention. Ever since, this place is filled with people and you will need to wait to be seated and not walk in as you like.

First you will expect a long queue but not to worry, there are plenty of chairs for you to sit while waiting. Expect to share tables with strangers - which I don't like! But that's the reality of this restaurant when it became famous. Once you place your order, you will be expected to eat and leave soon after. Since the queue is long outside (usually), people will just stare at you and make you feel uncomfortable.

Food quality wise is not fantastic anymore. Foreigners are cooking the meals these days and you can't expect for more. My favourite is the chicken chop and the toast bread. The noodles or chicken rice is not as good.

Once you finished your food, please make your payment at the counter."
0,Christine W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Like walking into a corner of a bygone era.
We took the train and walked -- no parking, no problem.
They get busy so be prepared for a wait.
Order a variety of things, including the roti baba, soft boiled eggs etc."
0,Ann C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,My favourite place ever! Food served almost immediately. Prices are cheap. Yes there is a wait and no reservations but turn over is quick. Be prepared to share tables with other guests. I recommend the hainanese Chicken Chop and also the roast pork during weekends. So many other choices from noodles to rice dishes. Authentic old school coffee shop feel. My childhood favourite. May be biased. But still my favourite place ever!
0,Ornnicha A.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"This is my second time in Hong kee. I was searching the best and authentic clatpot in KL for so long. This place won't let u disappointed.

We came here around 7.30. and we were in line for 1 hour. After we get the table, the food came. It was so good. We added more Chinese sagsage and salted fish.

The service was nice and friendly. When they saw me thried to take a picture of our group. They were trying to help us . They family and staff are cuteeee"
0,Alex P.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Definitely a great spot to try claypot chicken.  Food was super tasty and plentiful however you'll need to be on the look out for some bones with the chicken which isn't that big of a surprise for this type of cuisine.
0,L B.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"Really cool how they're able to replicate this dish outside.  Ive waited longer at a brick and brick for this dish.  Warning, the salty/salted fish is super pungent and salty.  You might want to get it without.  There are 3 different pot sizes.  For one, two, or three people.  The two will feed three.  Does that make sense lol who's on first?"
0,Suria N.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Earlier tonight we shared a table with another couple who were kind enough to let us sat together at their table. We had 2 claypot chicken rice with 'lap chong' or Chinese sausages. Just delicious. We love it. We complimented the dinner with young coconut. Perfect dinner for MYR34 or SGD11 for the two of us.
0,Vinay P.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Pretty good freshly cooked claypot chicken with cheap beers. Rice is nicely seasoned and slightly crispy. Unfortunately no vegetarian claypot options.
0,Kira N.,Restoran Kin Kin,"How did i ever go through life missing out on such an irresistible dish? This dish is none other than the OG chili pan mee at Restoran Kin Kin!!!

It was love at first bite for me when the flavor just plowed through like a wrecking ball! I'm not exaggerating. The dried fish with just the right amount of chili; along with the fried onions, and the perfectly soft, yet chewy noodles, gave my tastebuds their first ever wondrously unforgettable experience to last a lifetime. No one should go through life without experiencing this superbly flavorful dish. Don't be that one person, go here, get this, now!!!"
0,Angelo B.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Came here for bfast. I've never had pan mee before so don't have a benchmark, but I can say that the pan mee here is so good. Great combination of strong flavors. The chilli was extremely delicious too.

It's a hole in the wall type of place, and seemed to be full of locals.

It's a complete steal at only 8rng (approx 2usd).

I will try return."
0,Hannah E.,Restoran Kin Kin,"A great example of a place that does its one menu item perfectly. It doesn't need to add variety. If you want chili pan mee, you come here, and if you don't, you go elsewhere! Simple as that.

The dish itself is simple as well - noodles with anchovy pieces fried like bacon (at first I thought it was bacon), minced pork, and a soft boiled egg waiting to be cracked and its yolk used as a broth of sorts. The accompanying bowl of soft dark green leaves in a mild broth keeps you from burning yourself on the excessive table chili you're guaranteed to put in after you taste how good it is. It's so good that people apparently try to buy it straight, because the owner has written on the tile wall in Sharpie that he doesn't sell it separately!"
0,Andrea W.,Restoran Kin Kin,"This restaurant is located in a really random place and the place is really small and shabby. But, I came here for the chili pan mee, and it was delicious. The bowl of noodles was quite small, and in it were noodles, meat sauce, and an egg. Soup came on the side, and there was chili on each table for additional spice and flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles, and I highly recommend it! This could also serve as a snack as the portions are quite small (or get two bowls)."
0,Chang L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"A great example of small shop hospitality. The noodles were definitely good, but what takes the cake is how much the owner cares about his business and customers. Walking into this unassuming little shop with prices written on the walls I wasn't expecting much, maybe even a little less. Instead I was overwhelmed by how pleasant the owner was. He helped us order our meals, was attentive and obviously so proud of his noodles. He deserves 5 stars all the way."
0,ChauPha N.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Me and the boyfriend visit Restoran Kin Kin while we were on vacation in Malaysia. We checked Yelp and noticed that this place have a lot of good reviews and so we decided to stop in. The chili pan mee also look delish. When we first walk in, there will be someone to tell you to take a seat, then you just order your drinks and wait for the chili pan mee to come out. So that explains why Restoran Kin Kin doesn't have a menu because they only offer chili pan mee. For drinks, they offer herbal tea and also whatever soft drinks they have in the cooler.

I really liked my chili pan mee. The noodle is definitely homemade and the taste speak for itself. Portion size it's kinda small, if you have a big appetite, you might need to order another bowl.

Overall, I would recommend Restoran Kin Kin."
0,Karen T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"This is a chili pan mee institution. Love the texture of their homemade noodles to the spiciness of their chili flakes and the creaminess of their poached egg.

Definitely a must have when you are in the heart of KL and worth braving the jam for."
0,佩,Restoran Kin Kin,"At first, I was very happy that I can finally find a place to eat noodle in Kuala Lumpur. I was so excited to come here. However, first of all, they did not ask my friend and my permission if we can let other people to sit with us at a round table (which usually should be for us). They just suddenly let two person to sit down at the same table with us. The waiter service was very bad, he did not know English, and never gave us any menu and asked us what to eat. We asked for menu for a long time, but he never gave us as he did not understand English. We are foreigner around here, I did not know any menu over here. At last, he did not wait for our confirmation and placed the noodle to the chef which we did not even know what were our order were. The noodle which the waiter placed was just ok, not the best, but not too bad either, that's why I am giving 2 star for this review. Other than this, everything was bad. I am very disappointed about this local food restaurant in Malaysia."
0,Cat T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Of all the dishes my friend and I ate during out trip to Malaysia, we both agreed the dry Chili Pan Mee noodles at Restoran Kin Kin was the best. We ate this savory noodle dish at Kin Kin and also at another restaurant that is right across the street. Hands down Restoran Kin Kin was way better. The noodles were glutinous and chewy, the sauce had a perfect balance of seasonings, and the poached egg was done just right. The dish basically comes with a side of soup that was simple and good too. My friend and I didn't know how the order because their wasn't any menu, but shortly after we sat down the waiter just gave us the ""dry"" version. Later we saw on the wall you can order the dry or soup version."
0,Shuen P.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin Pan Mee is one of my favorite lunch time places back when I am working in Kuala Lumpur. It is about 10 minutes' walk from my workplace but me and my colleagues still goes there for lunch despite having to walk under hot scorching sun because we love their chilli pan mee. But not to the extent of stealing their chilli. For your information, there are pictures of people stealing their chilli displayed on their wall despite having CCTV installed. Besides chilli pan mee, they also serve 'yong liu' (mixtures of fuchuk, fish balls and meat balls).

To me, the only downside about this place is their ventilation system. The shop is hot and stuffy but it is worth it because I love their chilli pan mee. Even though I'm no longer working in Kuala Lumpur, sometime I still go back for their chilli pan mee."
0,Sue F.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I love Kin Kin because they make the best chilli pan mee in KL. The uncle who owns the shop makes the noodle from scratch, and he makes the chilli mix at the shop every morning. The chilli, which I always add sparingly, is the star of this dish. It's really hot so try a little first and add more as you go. And the poached egg on top is just the thing so that the whole dish is not too dry. The sweet potato leaf soup on the side is also good!

Oh, there's another Kin Kin outlet at Publika food court but nothing beats the taste of the noodles at the original shop.A lot of shops try to copy the style and quality of Kin Kin but they're not even close. The uncle once told me that he's flattered that a lot of people try to copy him but he's also upset because they don't credit him."
0,YongJie L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin Pan Mee is the best Chilies Pan Mee in the town! Well, at least I believe so, but they are very famous with the chilies Pan Mee. I came to know about this restaurant was introduced by my colleagues, we took LRT and walked all the way there (so it is that good that we are willing to walk that far).

The first impression was ""why no air cond T_T"", as I was sweating like hell after the long walk. The restaurant looks like those typical chinese kopitiam and it is quite stuffy inside, I think it was because of the crowd. I even spotted some customers eating with their blazer on. So, i was thinking this must be damn good. And, it turns out, i really love their Chillies Pan Mee. Something that i think it differs from others chillies pan mee in the town is the noodles. It is so good and smooth with the porched eggs. They do have a branch in the Publika Food court, the taste doesn't have a big difference from the main branch. So, the original taste vs air cond, i chose air cond.. Publika Food Court has became my another dinner spot."
0,Qui C.,Restoran Kin Kin,"My husband and I came during an off-hour and there was no wait and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. They make one thing: chili pan mee. All I did was raise up my hand and showed the older Chinese gentleman 2 fingers and within a few minutes, two bowls of chili pan mee came out. I absolutely loved this dish, with lots of chili. This was my husband's favorite meal during our trip."
0,Grace Y.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Only one item on the menu and basically that's what you have to get. But boy do they do it right. The noodle was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was meaty and flavorful. I am definitely a fan."
0,Andy S.,Restoran Kin Kin,Was surprised how good this was. Great texture of the homemade noodles. One dish restaurant done very well.
0,Ah M.,Restoran Kin Kin,"So it's s battle between Kin Kin vs Super Kitchen (across of Kin Kin). Both are good in my books but somehow, Kin Kin has the upper hand.

The place is newly renovated, I like the old decor more, minus the rusty and oil crusted kitchen equipment. Nothing a spoonful of cili can't fix though. A favourite of mine."
0,Maggie T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I would say I prefer Face 2 Face.

They are kinda famous for their Chilli Pan Mee, but well, maybe not really to the taste I'm looking for.

Well yes they are more established and do have a more traditional way of cooking it, I'm sorry but I still like F2F :( I find that the texture here is more towards the softer version.

The place look pretty old and vintage-ish, I really recommend that they refurbish the place to have a cleaner and tidier look. The alleys and everything else looked kind of dodgy. So it might attract dengue or maybe rats and cockroaches.... Who knows man. Pricing of the noodles here are about the average reasonable price. Choices for drinks are not many.

Well to be honest parking here might be an issue if you come during peak hours. There are lots of car workshops around that area. So make sure you don't park your car at the reserved spot. There are parking lots available at the back of the shop. You can park your car there."
0,Eugene L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I am a self proclaimed die-hard fan of chili pan mee lover, and Kin Kin Pan Mee is probably the holy grail of Chili Pan Mee as they are the real originators of this awesome delicacy. Kin Kin Pan Mee is situated in one of the shoplots between chow kit and jalan sultan ismail, this place is usually packed on any given day (even weekdays). Almost every time I visited this place, I would usually eat two bowls of chili pan mee (they are just too awesome!).

If you don't believed my words, do you know there is actually people came over for a meal and then stole the whole tub of dry chillies home and to an extent the owner got no choice but to install CCTV cameras in the shop to deter crazy customers. If you have not tried chili pan mee before, I highly recommend you to visit this restaurant at all costs, so that you can truly savour the real chili pan mee and it really is good!"
0,Ian L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Pan mee lovers surely know this place. Famed for its chilli pan mee, this unassuming shop in Kampung Baru is our favorite pan mee in town. The springy flour noodles topped with a soft, poached egg, minced pork, crunchy anchovies.
  The secret of this dish is the unlimited supply of dry, pan-roasted chilli flakes. Be prepared to wait for at least 15 mins to 30 mins for your dish though."
0,Julian T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin is probably one of the popular Chilli Pan Mee shops in town. It's actually my first CPM and man did I fell in love with it. Amongst all the CPM shops around, I feel that Kin Kin has the best and most flavored chilli. The chilli here actually gives the noodles part of its taste, whereas other places' chilli are only used to add the spiciness.

Another delicious dish that you should order here is the Pork Balls. Its a wonderful side dish that goes perfectly with your bowl of noodles. It's safe to say that I visit this place at least once a week and I'll never stop. The CPM here only comes in one size, so you just have to say how many bowls that you want, instead of choosing the size."
0,Horton L.,Songket Restaurant,"We eat thousands of meals throughout our lives, we forget most of them but there is always a few dishes that you will never forget. This is one of these meals for me.

After a relaxing 6 hour couple massage with the wife, we were so relaxed and ofcourse hungry. We looked up on the phone to see what was around to eat. Fortunately Songket was right next door tucked away in the back of an ally that had great reviews. So glad we went because it was a life changing experience.

We were there about 40 minutes before closing and was afraid they had nothing but pan drips left for us to lick on. But that was not the case at all.

Our friendly waiters seated us with a smile, they didn't act like we were there before they were about to close was an inconvenience to them, they acted like we were the only VIP customers that they had been waiting all day long. They quickly apologized the fact that we had just missed a live Malaysian dance show in the courtyard- bummer.

We decided to sit in the courtyard anyway, because it was decorated perfectly- the little urban tropical oasis. It was a late feb night so it was perfect temperature (however we did get a few mosquito bite). Our food experience was magic. Everything we had that night was delicious. Their food really put American restaurant scene to shame. We had a delicious appetizer, Malaysian prawns in spicy coconut sauce, some famous beef dish as our main course. We ordered two cocktails that were not only tasty, but also looked like art. All the flavor exploded in our mouths and it was a perfect ending to our spa day.

This place is a MUST if you are in Kuala Lumpur and I will for sure be back next time I'm in KL!!"
0,Kin C.,Songket Restaurant,"Great experience here! Delicious satay that is soft and flavorful, giant prawns in a coconut sauce that is reminscient of Tom yum soup but less spicy, and a chef special rice that is fragrant and sweetened with coconut. The starfruit juice was fresh. Prices are middle of the road, you can search for the menu online.

We went on a Wednesday night right on time for their 8pm show. Some traditional dances with music and other entertainment. Guests are encouraged to participate in using a blowdart and jumping over bamboo.

Friendly service, they helped me call a cab on the app."
0,Victor K.,Songket Restaurant,"Touristy but great fun. Typical Malaysian dishes. Great food; service a bit slow but packed so understood. Good value. The owner, Philip, walks around meeting guests. The owner, Philip walks around meeting guests and checking on orders.
Traditional dancing was a nice touristy touch."
0,Yusuke M.,Songket Restaurant,"I went when I had a 4 days tour in Malaysia, because of my colleague's recommendation. Malaysia traditional foods are very tasty and the dance is very nice. I recommend you if you want to enjoy Malaysia foods and dance."
0,Lucy Y.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"Delicious!  Super reasonably priced, too.  Our tour driver recommended this place to us and as soon as we took a bite of the spicy sauced rice, we understood why.  I had a fried chicken leg and it was juicy & perfect.  We loved it!!"
0,Dea D.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"I been here once. I wondered why was so many people queued. I joined and found a seat. I ate with my friends while enjoying the environment. 9.9/10 for Nasi Lemak. Really really great I swear. It's warm, delicious, the sambal also was also spicy, sweet, and in a big portion. Great while enjoying the environment. Totally recommend it!"
0,Alfie C.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"I've been a fan of Nasi Lemak when I was a kid. I remember when I was staying at UK for 7 months. Nasi Lemak is the first thing that came across my mind that moment. It's not hard to find Nasi Lemak these days when you are staying abroad. There are too many Malaysian restaurants in most of the countries and I bet all of them got Nasi Lemak on their menu. Well, Nasi Lemak has go international for a long time but here in Kampung Baru, they got a Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa of their own. You don't have to go abroad these days just have the international nasi lemak.

Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa has been in service for most of Malaysian stomachs for quite some times. There are various types of Nasi Lemak on the menu. Well, that's the reason I been there. Not because of some western cuisines or Nasi Kerabu, it is because of Nasi Lemak. I ordered a plate of Beef Nasi Lemak and I'm really satisfied with the result that came onto my table. A plate of extravaganza that include a medium portion of coconut rice, boiled egg, fried anchovies and cow lungs and also 'bergedil'.

They are quite generous in giving their sambal paste as well. It is something that we like from any food sellers. I heard that they already have few branches outside KL area as well but I'm not pretty sure."
0,Trena M.,Cantaloupe,"I can here for Sunday brunch, and the food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the view was stunning. Brunch was tapas style, with a set menu but you can pretty much order however much you'd like. Brunch was pricey, but with plenty of seafood and meat (baby squid, eel, lamb and beef)c, I can see why! Everything was very fresh and you can tell the food is quite high quality. My favorite was the poached egg with tomato and avocado, and I wish they had some more non-seafood and meat options. Even so, I was stuffed by the end of it. Having the sweet tooth that I have, I couldn't resist trying all the deserts. My favorites were the rice pudding and semolina cake, neither of which were overly sweet.

Portions are small, so it's perfect for tasting a bit of everything and re-ordering your favorites. I definitely want to come back in the evening, when the city is lit up."
0,Abby H.,Cantaloupe,It's absolutely amazing and the service is top notch.  We had the Degustation menu and I love every dish. It interesting and tasty combination of ingredients put together beautifully. Highly recommend.  Would come back again to try out their 8 courses lunch menu
0,Julie Y.,Cantaloupe,"Again, one of those fancy restaurants I'll never be able to afford on my own but thanks to my job, I've had the opportunity to dine at Cantaloupe. The first thing you'll notice is how quiet the place is, where you'll automatically walk a little slower, talk a little softer and eat a little more daintier. Start your meal with a pre-drink at the bar at Claret and soak in the majestic sight.

Cantaloupe offers a spectacular view of KL city and the twin towers, just dining by the dazzling lights alone is enough to impress your partner here. Food is an innovation here where the chef experiments with various elements, never failing to inject that wow factor whether it's the presentation or taste of the dish. Carnivores should not miss out on the wagyu beef steak, a heavenly mix of textures and flavours.

The selection of wine and champagne here is rather extensive so you'll feel obliged to pop open a bottle to justify the beautiful ambiance. Just be sure to take lots of photos!"
0,Ian L.,Cantaloupe,"Easily one of the best fine dining restaurants in town, Cantaloupe is where you go when you have some money to spend.
   Stylishly-outfitted with minimal designs, the place also offers a stunning view of KL skyline. The menu, curated by talented chef Chris Bauer is a delight. The express lunch set is a good way to learn more about the fine dining spot, at an affordable price.
   There are too many dishes that are stand-outs here (eg. foie gras sate with peanut butter sauce). But for your money, best splurge on their seasonal or degustation menu. Everything is beautifully executed and carefully curated. For special occasions, we highly recommend Cantaloupe."
0,Cedric C.,Cantaloupe,"As a big supporter of the molecular gastronomy movement, I've got nothing but praises for Chef Bauer's Cantaloupe. Modern fine dining with a creative concept, excellent wine, attentive service. Great place to celebrate a special occasion. Favourite dish was actually the deconstructed creme brûlée reminding us of a grant achatz creation. The dining scene in KL has grown significantly over the years and this is proof."
0,YongJie L.,Cantaloupe,"Cantaloupe, a fine dining restaurant located in the KL city with the best night view of KLCC. So, please be prepared for the price as well. I will not walk into such a place for usual dining as it is so expensive (I am not living a luxury life, LOL!).

I was there for a special occasion, my anniversary with my boyfriend. So, we thought of doing somewhere special to celebrate this special day. After googled a few places, we made up our mind to try out Cantaloupe, mostly due to the KLCC night view and the reviews are quite positive. The night was fantastic. I love the ambience in Cantaloupe, very grand and classy, quiet yet romantic, I think the best place for couples. The service was really good. The waiters were very friendly and able to give advices and good recommendation while we were asking for wine. The food were good and interesting. I was quite impressed by one of the starter, which looked like foams but actually taste very good. We took some photos outside of the restaurant after meal. I love everything in that night, it is a nice place, just a bit too pricey. :)"
0,Azraai A.,Cantaloupe,"I recently went on a date with a guy and knowing guys, they would always want to impress you on the first date right? Well this guy takes the cake. He asked me to pick a place and I said that I was fine with anything so he said he wanted to take me to Cantaloupe.

I arrived a little late due to Friday traffic and he was already waiting for me at the bar, we then proceeded to our table on the balcony outside, they don't usually serve food there but since were both smokers, they made an exception.

The wine list was impressive and we had a few dishes to share during dinner. The place was very classy indeed, you could almost taste the Champagne in the air. The wait staff was attentive and quick and surprisingly good looking. The food was very tasty, we had the baby squid amongst other things but I would recommend the spinach and cheese Bruschetta, I haven't tasted anything quite as phenomenal as that (I later tried to make my own at home but it didn't taste quite the same. Must have been all the adrenalin pumping through my veins that night.)

Well, we didn't go on a second date after that, you know how it is, we just didn't click over Baby Squid and Bruschetta."
0,Joe F.,Cantaloupe,"I absolutely love this restaurant. It is at least as good as a one-star Michelin. The tasting menu was large and varied at ridiculously low prices. The food was excellent, reminiscent of The Tapas Molecular (at the top of the Tokyo Mandarin Oriental), without the ""show"" but with much more flexibility on choosing menu items and much better availability for reservations. The view was spectacular - twin towers right out the large windows. The in-house smoked salmon was by far the best I have ever had in my long life.  This is a must do bucket-list restaurant if you ever find yourself in Kuala Lumpur. I might go back just to visit this restaurant again!"
0,Mat M.,Bijan,"The Bijan Restaurant in Kuala Lampur didn't disappoint!  Our hotel, the Intercontinental recommended it as a great local spot and made us a reservation.  We arrived and everything was prepared for us.  We had the Chicken Satay as a starter - and then had several local entrees.  We enjoyed 2 bottles of wine - and one of each of the desserts.  The service was fantastic from start to finish.  The cost was very affordable - and we were impressed how much food we got for the cost.

I would not hesitate to visit again in the future."
0,Chaza A.,Bijan,Great food and service. Loved the ambiance. The people were so friendly and ready to take care of us. The food was very tasteful. You gotta eat here!
0,Stephanie S.,Bijan,"Yum! I really liked this place. It was a good stop for our last dinner in Kuala Lumpur. The place has white tablecloths and a wine list. I got a fancy drink, a pineapple gin drink. It was pretty good. We got the vegetable fritter for an appetizer. It was really tasty and came with a spicy dipping sauce. For dinner I had Australian beef simmered in banana leafs which made kind of a curry. It was delicious. We also shared some Nasi Lemak rice and sautéed ferns with shrimp. We also had dessert which was a small warm cake with a shot of sugarcane poured over it and some coconut ice cream. Everything was delicious and the service was good. The whole meal cost about RM 350 or about $90 USD. Overall, it was a good stop."
0,Jimmy L.,Bijan,"Yelp isn't the place to come to reviews for restaurants in SE Asia (or probably anywhere outside of the US), so take mine with a grain of salt too because I clearly confided a bit too much in the ones before mine.

This restaurant based off yelp reviews and experience seems to be a family style tourist trap and yet here I am as a tourist, posting a yelp review. Bijan is deemed as a high quality restaurant (maybe it is, maybe it isn't) that failed to deliver.

I had the Ayam Masak Merah, chicken simmered in sweet/spicy blends that took me about a month to chew through each piece. Flavor wasn't bad though. Also had their seabass fillets that were served in a turmeric curry which although very flavorful, came with many surprise pieces of bones still in the fillets that perhaps I was too overzealous in expecting to be removed prior to.

If you're not into eating like the locals where you sit outside, occasionally eat with your hands, etc. etc.- then perhaps Bijan is for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in the culture and eat some real Malaysian food, do yourself a favor and skip Bijan.

The ambiance, service and price in USD was not bad but if you're in KL to have good food for a fraction of the price (and when I say fraction, think 1 as the numerator and a high number as the denominator).. Go to Jalan Alor or something and eat anything there- you're welcome in advance."
0,Yanoh J.,Bijan,"Loved this place! Now, it has 3 dollar signs, and I guess for Malaysia standards it is expensive. However, I had one of the more expensive items on the menu, wine, as well as an appetizer and my bill was less than $30 USD. So for a tourist it is extremely affordable. Service was amazing and quick here, the duck wasn't crispy as advertised but still very delicious. Spring rolls were amazing. My only regret is that I didn't find this place sooner."
0,Linda L.,Bijan,"My travel buddy and I found this place on yelp with a good amount of positive reviews.  Went to inquire it with our hotel concierge, they agreed it was the place to go so went and gave it a try.  The decor and ambiance was wonderful.  The service was great.  Our server was very attentive, each time our water and/or cocktail glass was near empty, he will come and ask if we wanted something else to drink.  As we were leaving, they even helped us get a taxi (taxi's are tricky in Kuala Lumpur).  However, the food was just mediocre and the price was definitely ex-pat / tourist price, on the high end.  We ordered two shrimp dishes with very different description and we must admit, the two dishes looked and tasted very similar.  The drinks were weak but they looked very pretty.  
Ambiance + Service + Cleanliness = 5 stars
Food + Price = 2 stars
Overall, I'll give it a 5 star experience.  If you want a nice and clean place to enjoy some Malaysian food with excellent service, I would recommend it.  If you're looking for some cost effective and tasty food, this place isn't it."
0,John W.,Bijan,"Food is spectacular! True ingredients and clearly almost everything is handmade. Totally impressed with the food, and the atmosphere is also very refreshing! Ambiance with the breeze and music is simply wonderful. This is a return to kind of place to try all they have to offer! Prices are also on point for what you get... it's Not overpriced at all. Almost feels like I stole from them based on what I paid for the quality of what I got!"
0,David B.,Bijan,Fantastic Malaysian dinner at a beautiful restaurant which throws a modern twist on traditional dishes. Friendly and helpful staff make this a great location for anyone new to the cuisine.
0,Jim D.,Bijan,"Fancy modern Maylay cuisine done extremely well.  Excellent service, good ambiance.  It is, however, rather expensive.  Excellent date night or expense account meal."
0,Peter L.,Bijan,"Bijan is a great place to try Malaysian fare in a stylish location and with a slightly modern twist.  The dining room is dark and spacious with an outdoor section as well.  We started off with a couple of classic apps - Popiah and otak otak.  The Popiah was ok but nothing special.  Better yet was the Popiah.  The Opor Rusuk was massive and beef ribs accompanied by a nice sauce of coconut and spices was wonderful.  Kerabu Mangga is the Malay answer to the Thai mango salad, and the version here is delicious - sweet, spicy, sour all at the same time.  There are some decent wine options as well and overall, I would definitely recommend Bijan for local food in a nice setting.  Plus it's also quite close to Bukit Bintang for plenty of after dinner options."
0,Vanessa O.,Bijan,"It was our monthly celebration but this time was for Raya. All ladies were dressed up in traditional Malay costume just for this occasion. It was a fun thought to be honest! Well we are usually dressed smart or at least smart casual. Although I'm not a fan of spicy delicacies, my own view was this place is the best place to go around. Food is good, comfortable ambience.

I was told that this place is usually the hangout place for tourist or foreigners (usually expats) to come around for a good meal of Malay cuisine. Personally I would think that it is expensive to savour Malay cuisine, but well, foreigners or tourist deserve to see what Malaysia / Malay cuisine can offer. This place offers real authentic cuisines!!
Parking wasn't that difficult, there is valet in operation, but you would expect to pay RM10 per car - which is quite expensive.

NO surprise that the menu can turn out to be slightly more pricey that any other Malay casual restaurant that you dine - again, you can't compare this place with those.. Again, I reckon this is slight upper class.

If you have friends that visits you from abroad, try to bring them here!!"
0,Vio L.,Bijan,"It's a nice place, the food is good and the atmosphere is relaxing. Avoid the durian cheesecake unless you know for a fact you like this fruit. I didn't mind the smell before, but 3 bites in and I had to throw in the napkin, can't be anywhere around durian ever since.

This restaurant is about 3 times as expensive as KL's average, but the food and service are not quite following the price tag."
0,Anna-Marie M.,Bijan,"Our first exposure to Malaysian food. This was fantastic. The atmosphere was gorgeous, service was great and the food was indescribable.
We ate so much it hurt but it was all so good I didn't want to stop.
I highly recommend the coconut creme caramel. I could eat it for every meal. So decadent!!"
0,B D.,Bijan,"Bijan is a great place to discover and enjoy Malaysian foods in a fine dining setting. We've been twice and intend to go many more times. Every dish we've tried has been fantastic except the otak otak (fish pate appetizer) which was just okay. It's worth trying the desserts, even the durian ones (cheesecake or chocolate cake). If you don't like durian in these wonderful desserts, I don't think you'll like durian in any form.

The wines are decent, the atmosphere is lovely and the staff is great!"
0,Ian L.,Bijan,"Voted as best malay restaurant in KL, Bijan is an upscale restaurant serving local malay cuisine. The decor is a modern and classic without much aunthetic touch.
   Once you're here, you'll immediately know that it's an upscale place (afterall it's located at the expat-centric Bukit Ceylon). It's a handsome restaurant nonetheless. But in terms of offerings, you can probably find similar dishes from your neighborhood warung.
  At Bjian,  you get a more 'atas' version of local cuisine - from beer rendang, cucur udang to ikan masak asam pedas -  all the kampung dishes get an upgrade here. When it comes to taste, even though it might not be as authentic as your hook cook meal (read: mild), it's well-prepared and tastefully done.
   But Bijan is perhaps a better place for tourists and expats who are looking for a crash course of Malay cuisine."
0,Clinton L.,Bijan,Bijan is a delicious contemporary take on traditional malay food. Full of flavour. Fairly expensive though compared to what else you can get in the city.
0,Peng P.,Bijan,"Pretty decent restaurant with awesome food and a reasonable price, which is much affordable than the equivalent restaurants in Shanghai/Beijing.

The cuisines is a mixed Chinese-Malay style. I would recommend it to my Chinese friend. Actually, we have French and American in the same table last dinner. They all loved the food."
0,Mark M.,Bijan,"I went here about a week ago with my wife and brother while we were in town. We were recommended by the concierge at the Intercontinental and we were certainly not disappointed. This is a fine dining restaurant that serves Malaysian specialities for prices far below fine dining in the United States. We ordered a little bit of everything and the waiters were very polite and gracious in explaining what everything was on the menu. Also, their wine list is very cheap! Will definitely be back next time I am in KL."
0,Spencer K.,Bijan,"We found the food to be excellent. Probably the best meal we had in Malaysia. The service left something to be desired, with several forgotten orders, otherwise this would be a 5 star review. Would recommend."
0,Serina W.,Bijan,"I would rate this place more of a 4.5 if that were an option. It is hard to think of anything that they could really do better. We ordered the following dishes: a seabass fillets in a tumeric sauce wth tomatoes (Gulal lemak ikan siakap), freerange chicken in a sauce with chillies, tumeric, kaffir lime and coconut milk (Ayam Kampunh Limau Purit), oyster mushrooms with prawns in spicy curry (Masak Lemak Cendawan tiram dengan udang), a coconut rice to go with all the awesome sauces and for dessert, durian ice cream, corn creme brulee, sago in coconut milk and palm sugar syrup. Our 3 main dishes were really all different variations of curry, with the seabass being the spiciest. All 3 were delicious in their own ways and flavours that are just not available in North America where we're from. Finished the meal off with a white coffee - very aromatic. Service was great. There was a tropical rainstorm as we were leaving and it was nice that they had an employee outside with a big umbrella to help you to your cab with minimal soaking. All in all a great meal!"
0,Ash H.,Favola,"WAGYU RISOTTO!! Definitely one of the best risottos I've had in KL. Very nicely done, flavourful with just the right texture, and the wagyu slices complete the dish perfectly. A must-try for those risotto lovers.

A little more about the restaurant - it's a nice Venetian-styled fancy eatery located in the Le Meridien Hotel in KL Sentral. It isn't too crowded on week nights and usually quite full on the weekends so making a reservation is highly recommended. Their online reservations work well and you will get a follow up call within the day.

Food and wine selection is great, and so is the dessert. They have a dessert trio of three sample-sized signatures that is great for sharing. Price isn't too over the top either, with the Wagyu Risotto priced at RM70++, which is decent for the quality of food and dining experience. Great place for dates too."
0,Peter L.,Favola,"Favola is the Italian restaurant at the Le Meriden Hotel at KL Sentral, while the restaurant is a little out of the way, tucked deep inside the hotel on the 8th floor, it delivers some outstanding Italian food.  The chef, Domenico Piras, learned to cook in Sardinia, and has a fascinating career cooking everywhere from Michelin starred restaurants to the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.  I stopped by for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I selected a two-course express lunch and my starter was a beautifully presented salad topped with calamari rings.  The starter was fresh and flavorful and also filling.  The main course was a Sardinian pasta with a sauce that was cooked for 8 hours.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing, with melt in your mouth beef and some interesting spices. The bread selection is also very good, and served with 3 dips -  balsamic vinegar and olive oil, cheese, and mushroom.  I didn't get a dessert, but ended with espresso and biscotti which was perfect.  Service is friendly and helpful and the whole place brings everything together.  Definitely worth a try while in KL Sentral!"
0,Jacky L.,Favola,"It was amazing. The classic caprese salad was a nice light way to start off the meal. I liked that the bread plate came with different types of bread and also 3 options for dipping. The mains were consistently good. My favorite was the Maccheroni Puttanesca. The porcini mushroom was another highlight, the duck foie gras went well with the creaminess of the mushroom risotto. The homemade potato gnocchi was very filling and a bit creamy. It was a carbalicious delight, heavy for dinner but worth it."
0,Nadhira S.,Favola,"Amazing concept!

This place is smack on the 8th floor of Le Meridien Hotel, at KL Sentral and it seems everything there feels so Italian. It has such an Italian vibe. When you walk in you will see a big mural of faces of clowns, different versions of the sun and even a somewhat looking Versace logo. Ha ha! When you look up at the ceiling - it has roman words on it in the carvings, just like some of the museums, churches and cathedrals in Europe. The whole symbolism of the place also reminds me of Dan Browns 'Da Vinci Code' like the chequered floor and gaudy furnitures. SO Italian."
0,Jyn-Yann N.,Favola,"This is my favourite Italian restaurant. I just love their seafood risotto however if you eat too much of it, you will become sick of it. The decoration of the place is very nice and adorned. The food is amazing. Even the bread that they provide on the house tastes lovely. Unfortunately, the price is terrifyingly expensive. I would love to go again even though the money spent on that dinner would suddenly make my wallet a whole lot lighter."
0,Jeffrey Q.,Favola,Last night in KL. The restaurant is in the hotel. The food is really good. The pizza and pasta are delicious.
0,Jyn-Mun N.,Favola,"Favola is an authentic restaurant that serves Italian food that not only look very nice and appetising, but also taste very nice and appetising. The food includes pasta, seafood, pizza and others and they have one of the best selection of Italian wines. The cost is pricey, but it's normal for an authentic Italian restaurant in a hotel."
0,Huan C.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Can you taste and experience the difference?

I ordered half of a duck as it appears to be a popular food option based on past reviews. This is a popular restaurants among local. Just a heads up to foreigners, they don't have a menu, but they did have a young waitress who spoke English. If you are able to speak a regional language, you just name what dish you want prepared.

My duck was a bit of an eye opener. I am very custom to having fatty duck that having lean ducks was a breath of fresh air. The duck along with the sauce was delicious. It was simple but yet the meal was more meaningful I have previously encountered. The meal provided a new sense of appreciation regarding meal and food consumption.  

Since they didn't have a menu, I didn't quite know the price. I paid approximately 39 malaysian ringgit (close to $9.50)."
0,Guy F.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Came here for first time with local friend.  HSD the roast duck, pork soup with figs, egg with shark fin and crab, kang kong, and ended with pancake with lotus paste filling.   All the dishes were very flavorful, also had some shell in my crabmeat egg.  Roast duck was not fatty which was nice.  The soup had nice pork flavor and the fig was pleasant sweetness.  Servers were nice too.  No prices on menu, but our bill was fair and reasonable, so trust them.  The lotus paste filled pancake was nice way to end our dinner."
0,Amalie E.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"The best authentic food experience ever in a long time.
I often get emotionally touched by things, but rarely by food. This dinner reminded me about my childhood,  my grandma,  home,  family & traditions,  I almost cried (def my heart) The sweetes hostes - an elderly grandma, caring for me & looking after I have what I need. Just amazing!"
0,Adelynn T.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"One of the oldest and traditional restaurants in KL/Pudu. This place was opened many many years ago and has 2 sides of the restaurant. One is the old side (without aircond) and the other side has aircond. This place is run by a family. That's why mostly the employees are old or mixed up.

What's good here? Well, i normally go with the pei pa duck which is crispy and awesome! The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. DELICIOUS!

Vegetables - You can just ask them what vegetable that they have for the day..and you pick your choice and the style of cooking (with belacan or just normal plain garlic style).

Sometimes, we will have the sang choi pow..which is fried egg + crab meat + some glass noodles..you wrap it with raw vege (iceberg lettuce leaves) it's sorta the salad in asian way.

During Chinese New Year, you can have the traditional yee sang...which is raw fish slices with strips of ginger in the yee sang. That's the olden version of yee sang in a more wealthy way. Or you can always order the jellyfish version.

If you want to have a dinner here during Chinese New Year, a more customised way, you can book a table here and order the dishes first. Of course, a deposit would be needed (Just in case if you don't appear)...There are all sorts of dishes and they will recommend to you too!

Overall experience : 5/5 (One of my fav place to makan)
Price Rating : 4/5 (Affordable according to my family since it's good chinese food)"
0,Lisa W.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"One of my faves. Hands. Friggin. Down.

My family has been going here for literally generations. This place be hella old.

I'm gonna be completely not-politically correct and suggest you get the sharks fin egg lettuce wraps. Yes. Good Lord.

Another thing that sends the cherubim of heaven into sweet, melodic, song is the poached chicken with ginger sauce. Dat sauce.

Also, the Pat Poh Ngap is one of the best I've ever tasted. Though, that said, it's a little difficult to compare with other places because I've pretty much only had it here and one other place.

Go. You'll discover the meaning of true love."
0,Alan's O.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,Taste the great authentic cuisine of malaysian chinese. Recommended food- duck - crab meat ball - dao si fish
0,Wye Mun K.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"This restaurant has been here since my grandparents were born, the iconic old fashioned Chinese Restaurant, Sek Yuen. They're famous for a couple of dishes such as their King Pork Ribs. The cooks here are really old uncles that look like grandfathers, which you can say are well experienced enough with their food.

It's rather run down, but the food here is just great. They cook their food not using gas but using wood instead so you get the real ""wok hei"" when you eat here. Apparently cooking with wood gives your food a better taste. You can also order their Fermented Bean Paste Fish which is really good. I've been eating here since I was a kid so I definitely recommend trying this place actually closes."
0,Annabelle Y.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Comforting fare cooked by elderly chefs in a restaurant filled with nostalgia and history, that's what Sek Yuen is all about. They certainly know their Cantonese cuisine as every dish is cooked with love and just the right touch of saltiness. The walls, decked with black and white photographs depict the years they have toiled to achieve the top-notch status that they currently hold. So onwards with the food! Start off with the cold appetizer dish that comes in a huge plate (Lang poon) filled with various morsels of delight from mushrooms, boiled jellyfish,  sesame infused meats and seafood. The perfect way to cleanse one's palate before the torrid of dishes begin. The roast duck was just perfectly thin and crispy, the way it should be done while the braised lamb dish was hearty fare and sauce amazing doused over the fluffy white rice. We also ordered 2 different greens to balance out the meal. They of course came well fried and still crunchy. Overall, don't expect fine dining, but do expect to walk out with a very full stomach"
0,Rick B.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,What I am looking for- great food and right atmosphere. Awesome place to blend in with the locals.
0,Shan K.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Went here with the fam for CNY eve lunch. Heard a lot about this restaurant being the oldest Chinese restaurant in KL...plus, they use wood-ovens to cook the food. SOO I was pretty excited to try it.

The menu was pre-selected and booked by my aunt, so we didn't actually have much of a choice. Of course, we started with yee sang - which was delicious! Great taste but no salmon. Regardless, it was the tastiest yee sang I had all CNY. Then we had the four seasons dish (basically a seafood platter) which was also pretty good. Next came sauteed chives with roasted pork belly - noms! Great dish - generous on the pork. Then, we had fried yam topped with cashew nuts, diced chicken, onions and bell peppers. Small portion but delicious. I wasn't too impressed with the Chinese mushroom dish which came next - average. Pork ribs were awesome. Chunky, meaty, perfectly done. Steamed fish was also average but fresh. Last but not least came the duck. This famous duck that everyone was raving about was definitely too hyped up. The skin was amazing but there was barely any meat and the meat was tough. I've had better duck.

Ambience wise, it's your typical chinese coffee shop...super casual and loud..holes in the tablecloths etc. But I think it adds to the ""old"" feel. We sat at the outside part of the restaurant since the ACed side was full. Despite being outside, they had a lot of fans and good ventilation.

I'd be excited to come back and order some of their other dishes. A great first experience."
0,Kent T.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,Try the crisp duck and salted fish steam with minced pork. Authentic cooking. A cuisine way back to memory lane!
0,JD H.,Alor Food Corner,"I am placing this review under this particular corner listing but it really represents an entire food area in the heart of the action in KL. This is my first time in Malaysia and the food scene is impressive. At the corner of Jalan Alor and Changkat Bukit Bintang starts the long Eat Street that extends all the way down Jalan Alor. For any seriously adventurous foodies, come here for a foodgasm. There is a shop at the corner open 24 hours for those of you jet-lagged like me that need something to do at 3 am and the rest of the street is pretty much shutting down by 4 am but this entire area really doesn't get going until after dark and into the wee hours of the morning.

There are food shops lining the street and in front of many of them are street vendor carts. The whole place smells like Durian which can be either good or off-putting depending on if you like that smell and all of the areas to sit and eat are outdoors so there is no escaping it. Also, the heat can be oppressive but once the sun goes down, the temperature gets noticeably cooler.

Walking up and down Jalan Alor I saw places that sell Indian food, Malaysian food, Thai food, Chinese food, North Vietnamese food, South Vietnamese food, Hong Kong Dim Sum, Fruit carts, Smoothie carts, Coconut carts, Ice Cream carts, Vegetarian spots, Halal spots, and on and on it goes. You get the picture. The people watching was pretty incredible in the early evening too and it is so packed that you better like pressing flesh in a hot, sticky environment with strangers.

I was so overwhelmed by the choices, the foreign languages, the signs I could not read, and the vendors yelling hawker talk to me that I could not decide what to eat and frankly didn't recognize half of the stuff they had. I finally just sat at an empty table and one of the vendors looked at me when I sat down and grunted what I believe was a greeting in my general direction. She looked at me expecting me to order or do something and I had no idea what I was doing or what she even had on offer so I did the next best thing to faking a seizure in an emergency awkward situation...I put on my lost tourist face and said, ""Please just feed me"" which she did by wok frying up a plate of fresh noodle with shrimp, chicken and crunchy fatty pork bits with a sauce made from dark soy. For $10 Ringgits (about $2.35 USD), it was the right call. Savory and deeply smoky from the wok, it totally satisfied.

I'm planning to go back to the area again tonight, sit somewhere else, and try the lost tourist approach again to see what I get. Kind of like rolling the dice in Vegas with your food options. This entire area is amazing if you like local culture, local food, and aren't afraid to feel out of your element. This is a special place, along the lines of a Singaporean hawker center or an open air wet market in Vietnam. If you are in the area, don't miss it."
0,Ray Chen C.,Alor Food Corner,"We went there because of all the lengthy good reviews.
However, it turned out to be a bit disappointing.

We waited 45mins at least to get dished served, small portion and not that cheap in terms of the food amount inside the dishes.  But the taste is ok, not super good but ok.

It is at the head of a extremely busy food street, so would suggest to try out some others instead of having the same not so impressed meal again."
0,Adam G.,Alor Food Corner,"If you're in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia...you MUST visit this cool spot.  The food stands at this corner are all extremely good!!!  Man, I feel that everyone will love the food as much I did...what an awesome experience I had at this corner.  Loved it!!!  :)"
0,Fatma H.,Alor Food Corner,"Very good place, it s local, basic (including the service) but nice people and delicious food. You really need to try it even if the place is not that fancy."
0,Nicole S.,Food Republic,"Food Republic is a food court located in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur. I frequent this food court and have tried pretty much everything. My favorite stall would be the thai food as they make very food phad thai and tom yam mee hoon. There is a soya stall and youtiou too. The curry rice here however is very expensive and not worth it. A plate of rice, one vege and 2 meats can come up to RM15 which i think is just ridiculous for mix rice that you can get for a fraction of the price at chinese shops.

The food court is always packed regardless what time it is. Morning, noon and night you would have trouble looking for a table but I think its just cause everything here is just so yummy and there's a good selection of different types of food too."
0,Nora F.,Food Republic,"Pavilion offers many food places for those hungry people. Food republic is located downstairs. It's like a food court where people find different types of food from different corners and stands. I walked around to see what I feel like eating, hmmm. I was very confused looking at what they had to offer. A lot of food to feed my need. Finally I ended up at Nasi Padang section and ordered that. I had rice with fish, chicken and okra. Wow! The fish was very good! This took-too-long-to-order dish really paid off! I had a lot of questions prior to my order, pardon me! My sister had spicy fish filet from Little Wok and that was awesome! This one came in a big metal bowl along with tasty vegetable. Her friend had beef pepper rice. I tried everything and we had a winner! Me! Because I had the pleasure to try them all!"
0,Jon C.,Food Republic,"This food court in particular has several different options that are international brands.

There is coco curry house and pepper steak. I saw Thai options. There is a dim sum option (not very good).

Overall a good variety of food, affordable but not the cheapest/tastiest food. I'd say if you're looking for Malaysian food, you'll probably find Christ/tastier food elsewhere, but they have the options to fill the void."
0,Juan S.,Food Republic,"Great food court. From food stalls to restaurants. Big lunch crowd at lunch and weekends. Toast Box is my favorite place to get local Malaysian Kopi. Takes a while to try all the food here. Nasi padang, Thai, Korean, Ramen, wontons, tepanyaki and more.  Big kudos for the support staff that cleans the tables. Super efficient in getting table cleaned. Great place to get a bite to eat after walking the mall."
0,Rory B.,Food Republic,"So many different options in one place!  The hardest part is picking which one to try, but it's great for groups since everyone can pick there own cuisine.

Food is really good and pretty inexpensive.  Although I like the really ""authentic"" experiences like Jalan Alor or Hutong for the ambience, this is still a great and easy option, especially if some people prefer the ""cleaner"" indoor food court."
0,Brenda L.,Food Republic,"The best food court I have ever seen! The options are endless. I tried my 1st ever nasi lemak here @ a spot called (surprise?) Nasi Lemak. The dish was huge and under $4 US dollars and was super filling. It came with chicken, a side of salty fish, coconut rice, cucumber and shrimp chips. Aside from that, there are dessert spots like a cheesecake store, Beard Papa (where you can get durian cream puffs), Eggette (the wait here is long-beware). My friends had hot pot and ramen here & they all thought it was great. It's really hard to decide what kind of food you want because they have so many great and appetizing options. I really wish this food court existed in Denver or San Jose."
0,Kevin W.,Food Republic,"If you want to be spoiled for choices, you are at the right place, Food Republic, is a massive food court in Pavilion KL there has many types of food to choose from.
Name it from local cuisine to, Hong Kong style, Taiwan style, Thai, Indonesian, Western, Italian, Japanase, whatever it is, you can find it at Food Republic.

I do like the nasi lemak from the nasi lemak stall at Food Republic. I really like their sambal. Sambal is one of the most important ingredient in nasi lemak that must be right, if not all will fail.

I tend to have a hard time choosing what I want to eat while at the food court because I want to eat everything! Also during lunch and dinner time, this place is usually packed and getting a table may be difficult. So plan your time properly to avoid such hassle."
0,Ian L.,Food Republic,"Originated from Singapore, Food Republic has been one of my favorite places to go when I visit Singapore. The open format here in Pavilion follows very much like its sister company.
   However, almost every time I am here I go to the tepanyaki store. The delicious tepanyaki grilled by chefs on the spot guarantees the freshness of food. A set meal only cost you RM15.90 with a choice of meat, soup, rice and two types of vegetables! Definitely worth the money.
   The char kuay teow store was a serious disappointment. Not only the portion is small, it's way too oily to our liking. Claiming it as 'Penang' char kuay teow might even be false advertising. Also, the juice counter is somewhere you want to avoid. A cup of juice will set you back around RM6 with only a few mouthful (they added a lot of ice).
   Even though is not perfect, Food Republic is still a cheaper choice in Pavilion."
0,Derrick V.,Food Republic,"Excellent food court in Pavilion mall. There's a chicken rice spot that was sadly, way better than the ones I tried in Singapore. Sergeant chicken rice is the name I think, but just look for the hanging steamed and roasted chickens. Really flavorful chicken and rice. As you can tell, I tried this dish a lot on this trip haha"
0,Shan K.,Food Republic,"Good selection here - not just Malaysian food. Prices are decent but a little more on the pricier food court side (depending on the stall). I think it's pretty obvious, but try to avoid lunch hours (11:30am - 1:30pm) as it gets super packed/hard to find a table. The cooks tend to be more rushed during that time and thus, the food not as well prepared/portions not as generous.

Wish they had more options for drinks though. Mostly the standard syrupy drinks and some fresh juices. If you're looking for awesome Malaysian food, I'd recommend going to Hutong (Lot 10 food court) instead. So much amazing food down there and just a 2 min walk from Pavilion."
0,Vanessa W.,Food Republic,"Usually if I go Pavillion I will surely go to their food court to eat . The food court have a lot of food to choose . I remember trying the korean food ,chiken rice and spaghetti over there . The one that I love the most is the spaghetti and macaroons !  The portion ofthe food is quite big and it is not really expensive . It only cost about RM15 to RM 20 per plate . I like the one with carbonara sauce and some bacon on it . While my mother likes their spaghetti with olive oils. It is called as seafood spaghetti if I am not wrong. The food court will be quite crowded especially during the peak hour . It is a self service food court so we need to take the fork and spoon by ourselves and ofcourse we must collect the food ourselves ."
0,Diviyah G.,Food Republic,"Food Republic is a food court in Pavilion that offers a WIDE range of food to choose from. I love this food court mainly because of their variety. The cuisines range from Thai to Malaysia to Western to Japanese to even Hong Kong. It's one place where you can find many different delicacies from different countries. This food court is very clean and crowded all the time, especially on weekends. If you're going during peak hours, make sure to get there early to find a place first before getting your food.

The food is fairly good but I feel that it is a little bit on the expensive side for a food court. The price I pay for a bowl of Yong Tau Foo dish here is what I would pay for 2 bowls elsewhere. Overall, if you're looking for variety, this is the place. I go here when I cant decide which restaurant to go to as this gives me many options to choose from. Do give it a try!"
0,Ryan Q.,Food Republic,"Located in Pavillion, there are many variations of cuisines in stored for the public. From Teppanyaki, Western, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Indian Stalls, to typical Chinese food, Vegetarian stalls and many more.

To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetarian dishes  here. Found it kinda greasy and rather than taking the dishes yourself, the people there are the ones placing it on your place. The helpings are kinda small too.

Prices here are quite high. I paid RM 15 for my meal and to be frank, for typical Chinese Vegetarian food, you'd expect it to be cheaper. Probably it's because of the exorbitant rentals here. I also think people come here because of the convenience during lunch hours. Nonetheless, you're better off at other restaurants in this mall."
0,Jay O.,Food Republic,"Food republic are one of the prominent and well-known food court in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Even tourist are familiar about their existence. But those of you who not now, I feel very sorry for you, open your computer and search google. I am kidding, please don't take it seriously. Haha (sorry for the teasing)

Food republic is a food court that has remarkable variety of food stall that consists Korean, Japanese, Taiwan, Indonesian, Thai, Local and multitudinous more. Well, as for a local boy that grew up here in Kuala Lumpur. I would definitely their food stall especially Hot Plate , Korean food and Local food. It's DAMN good!! I mean if you don't mind food court, this are the food stall that you should visit!!! However, food republic are extremely wide and crowded.  You might faint just by observing the loads of people walking around food republic.If you worry about their food quality or cleanliness? Don't worry. They are pretty good!!! but don't try their Yong tau fu stall -Expensive and taste dreadful. Besides, if you ever need some drinks. They have a specific stall that only sells beverages, either beverages that are jam packed with ice or hot. Price range are from RM 8 to RM 25. Depending on your food.

Overall, I am satisfied with their food and I could assured you their food are pretty amazing. Some of them are might be better than other ""high-class"" restaurant, seriously. No kidding!"
0,Wye Mun K.,Hakka Restaurant,"One of the oldest restaurants in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. It's located opposite Pavilion. Hakka Restaurant has been around for god knows how long and they have been packed ever since they opened. They've renovated their restaurant and it looks a lot bigger and nicer compared to before.

They serve Hakka dishes here and Chinese dishes here. But what I love about this place is that, they even have steamboat!! The steamboat here is really good too I must say. I always come here for steamboat with my family. You can order sides for your steamboat such as pork slice, pork liver and many other fresh poultry as well. They're always full so make sure you make a reservation or head over early to get ahead of the crowd!"
0,Jay C.,Hakka Restaurant,"The location is literally surrounded by buildings. A one big flat opening in the middle of highrise buildings.
The food is great. Is a fusion of Chinese Malay style. Must try the lettuce wrapped sauteed pork, pork with bun and crab meat in its shell.
The day I went there was Carlsberg beer girls doing the beer promotion I guess because, as soon as I empty my cup there was the girls pouring it. Something I don't get to experience in US.
It really gets packed so, expect to wait 10~20 minutes if you come during dinner time."
0,Clarence J.,Hakka Restaurant,"(This is probably more like 2.5 stars to me, but I'm rounding up because of the potential here.)  I was underwhelmed by the food on my first visit, but I do plan to try again as the environment is great, the prices are good, and many things on the menu looked good so perhaps I just chose poorly.

If the environment was rated separately, I'd give it four stars easily.  There's an indoor section, but the larger dining space is a huge open-air 'hall' under an excellent retractable roof that is opened in great weather.  Bamboo shades can be lowered from the sides in the case of rain, and numerous ceiling and side fans keep the air moving.  (You'll still be warm on a hot day of course, but it's not too bad.)  The white tablecloths over the tables contrast nicely with the lively lime green of the plastic chairs.  There are tables of numerous sizes, each of the larger ones with a turntable in the middle to ease sharing of food.

In regard to the food, while the menu is extensive and has numerous excellent-looking things, what I tried was unbalanced.  The salt-and-pepper prawns were beautifully cooked but I found them to be overly salty.  Meanwhile, the grilled ostrich was rubbery and didn't have much flavor [and I have had ostrich many times and usually thoroughly enjoy it], although the ginger, onions, peppers, and sauce for the dish were all wonderful.

The staff was efficient.  Some of the people I interacted with engaged with a smile, while others were brusque.  Everything for us was taken care of fine, but there did seem to be a bit of confusion or overlap among the waitstaff as numerous people came by to check the ticket on our table during our meal (which I assume was to make sure we had everything we had ordered) and several others asked if we wanted to order more drinks, sometimes right on the heels of the previous person who had asked."
0,Gary A.,Hakka Restaurant,"My local friends in KL and I eat here once or twice a month. This place is a KL icon- I think they've been operating for 60 years or so.  The menu is great and they're very flexible for a vegan like me.  Great great great Chinese food.  Love me some sautéed sweet potato greens!

The atmosphere is truly outdoor family picnic style.  If you're lucky it will start to rain and the auto-roof will extend and shield you.  Come casual- life is good!

Great desserts, noodles, tofu a million different ways, and plenty for omnivores, too.

Service is eh, but they get the job done."
0,Vanessa O.,Hakka Restaurant,"This is a famous Chinese restaurant that has been there perhaps since when I was little girl. One night after work, my colleagues were craving for their famous deep fried pork leg. I wasn't a fan but I tagged along just to catch up with my colleagues and have fun.

It was a pity that my phone was low batt and I didn't have a power bank with me, hence no pictures of the food that we ordered - maybe next round. Anyway, we were seated in the air-conditioned room and within seconds, the waiter came over to place orders for us. Although that place was packed - I was pleasantly surprised for their prompt service. Only later I realised that each waiter/waitresses were designated to a few tables under their service. How neat!

Price range was between RM18 above and man, I remembered that the famous deep fried pork leg cost RM50++ for a small serving. I wasn't keen to try my next round perhaps it is because I simply don't find it delicious - again, I'm not a fan of pork. But don't get me wrong, it is very crispy outside and tender meat inside.

Other dishes were ordinary and overall, I did enjoy myself very much. So if you are a pork lover, give it a go!"
0,Shev R.,Hakka Restaurant,"Amazing food. Very authentic Malaysian. I would def recommend. Fried rice, spicy shrimp and crispy chicken."
0,Su Zanne C.,Hakka Restaurant,"Placed right  behind of Pavilion Shopping Mall, Hakka Restaurant is a family conducive Chinese restaurant that is half indoors and half in the open air, made possible with a convertible rooftop. On a good dry night, you could be dining under the stars with a great view of Pavilion, and on a rainy night, you will be kept safe from getting drench. The semi-outdoor experience is a nice change. Having some fresh air while you dine is one of the best feelings other than being among family members.

Among all the different types of dishes that we have ordered, it was the famous Hakka Kau Yoke (steamed pork bellies) with preserved vegetables that stood out. The pork was tender with a good amount of fats for those who love eating the fats, and the preserved vegetables are pickled well with a tinge of saltiness. Best to eat this dish with rice to balance everything out."
0,Rebecca W.,Hakka Restaurant,"My family has been wanting to have some Hakka cuisine for the longest time, so we finally embrace the KL traffic and went to Hakka Restaurant. The restaurant is located opposite of Pavilion.

Whenever we dine at a Hakka restaurant, we would definitely order Yam Abacus Seed. The Abacus Seed in Hakka Restaurant was really good, nice texture with a pleasant yam flavours. The Crispy Duck was pretty good too - nice crispy skin with tender meat. On the other hand, the Pig Intestines with Pineapple was slightly disappointing. The texture of the intestines was good, but the pineapple was slightly over-powering.

Overall, the food was good and I heard the German Pork Knuckle was delicious. Sadly, we did not order this that night, but will mostly give this a try during our next visit."
0,Stephen L.,Hakka Restaurant,Great traditional Chinese restaurant. It is a Hakka restaurant. It is of the dialect of Chinese people who are guest in the past. This is my favorite restaurant that I take my oversea guest to try the authentic Chinese food.
0,Louise A.,Skillet @ 163,"I know you all think this place is to expensive but really, its not! If you eat there you will give them all the money you have left ;) this was crazy good. And not in a regular way, this was an experiance! First of all it was clean and stylish. Second of all they spoke great english and that actually means alot when you just been in vietnam where you have to do gestures and everything. They gave great service and they had 3 extra dishes for free when you already ordered 3. They had set menues for around 130RM, thats what we took. So first we got an apetizer and newly baked bread then we got our starters, I had a lobster cappuccino  really good and with a bit of a heat in it and coriander. My man got fois gras and it was beautiful. Lovely. For main I had lamb with so many flavours in a perfect mix and balance. My man got this crabpasta with tigerprawns. Crispy and delicious! Had some huge fisheggs on it, tasted so good, they usualy dont have any really taste but theese were smoky and fishy so for desert whish was the best part, I had an apricot sorbet thing with rochefort. It was amazing, very interesting tastings but so nice!!
And my man had this chocolate sticky pudding with a caramel sause and vanilla icecream, we both could die for that one! I didnt want it to end. It was just amazingly good!
After that they gave us some chocolate bites, and their coffee was also according to my man fab.
The backgroundmusic was good, not to lound but there. Its just around the corner from the twintowers, like 4 minute walk. The waiters were very kind and knowledged, its a must in kuala lumpur."
0,Alma P.,Skillet @ 163,"Seriously good food here folks... this was one of the BEST meals I had on this trip to Asia. At least as good, if not better than the two and three star michelins we dined at in Singapore.

We opted to do the prix-fixe menu for two and were impressed with every dish that came out. Everything we cooked perfectly with amazing flavor combinations. The menu changes seasonally so I am reticent to list our menu but my favorite dish was the pan seared five spice duck breast. It was DIVINE and if it's on the menu when you go I HIGHLY recommend you try it.

The service was also stellar here - very attentive and helpful. I love that the chef also came out to interact with the patrons. I didn't see this anywhere else in Asia so I was impressed that the took the time.

With the exchange for US vs Malaysian dollars so favorable to us I almost felt like we got away with murder for this meal....delicious murder. ;)"
0,Paige K.,Skillet @ 163,"The food was very good and creative. One course was a little heavy too cheesy, but everything else had a nice balance and fun element to it.
Dessert was definitely my favorite
The staff were very friendly and informative. Chele my waitress was so nice."
0,K W.,Skillet @ 163,"I've been somewhat disappointed with most of the dining in KL. Perhaps I'm getting picky in my old age, but honestly, My gut tells me the food scene here is a bit overhyped.

On our last day we were looking for some place convenient to our hotel, Fraser Place, and found we didn't even have to leave the building to grab lunch.

We both ordered a soup and salad. Followed by a shared dish of their carbonara pasta.

In a word... WOW!

The tomato soup was one of the best I've had... ever. That's saying quite a bit for a New Yorker of Italian descent. It was clearly made with fresh tomatoes and was expertly finished with just the right amount of basil. It wasn't overly sweetened the way most tomato soups can be and was the perfect texture for a hot KL day, not too thick but not too watery either.

The salads were fantastic. We ordered the crab and avocado along side the duck confit salad. Both were crisp, refreshing and hit the spot after a hot bowl of soup.

The pasta dish was wonderfully rich, perfectly al dente, with an awesome blend of melted cheeses, spices and beef bacon. Coming from America, we go in for the whole hog when it comes to bacon, so this was a first for me. I was thoroughly impressed. I couldn't believe how spot-on the hickory smoke flavor was in the shredded strips of fatty beef. Had I not paid attention to the fact that pork was overtly replaced with something clever in virtually every option on the menu, I would have been completely fooled. The shaved parmesan flake on top of each dish provided the added saltiness this plate would have been missing otherwise. All in, it was a fantastic blend of flavors with the right separation of bacon and parmesan as contrasting layers that really made this dish sing. Half a plate was the perfect helping after a couple of starters. If you're looking to crawl into bed and nap afterwards have an entire bowl to yourself. It will be a well spent evening.

The service was incredibly friendly, and the chef went out of his way to plate the pasta in separate bowls for us when he saw on the ticket that we had only ordered one main between the two of us. Shows that they're paying attention to the details.

I couldn't find something negative to say about this place if I tried. They seem to have a well disciplined staff that isn't too stuck up or snooty. The menu is superb. It manages to pull off subtle creativity while still delivering on preconceived expectations of what the same dish may have tasted like had mom cooked it back home (wherever that may be). The vibe is smart but relaxed. The open concept and friendly attitude is contagious. Don't be surprised if you find yourself making friends with the guests that are seated right next to you.

If you get the chance, stop in. You'll be glad you did. Kudos to the team behind this place. A true oasis in a city of overwhelming options."
0,Jerry C.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Tapas were on our minds and we decided to skip the mall chain restaurants. Pinchos was pretty highly rated so we made a reservation and dashed over. The place was packed with ex-pats. Outside tables, bar, front and back mezzanine dining rooms. Luckily our table in back was ready.

Along with a bottle of Pedra da Auga Albariño 2012 Spanish wine, three of us ordered 9 dishes! There were probably 30+ tapas to select from. Every dish was top notch delicious. We could not go wrong.

My favorite was a special: Fresh Octopus leg, pulpo, flown in from Spain and grilled. It was perfectly cooked and not chewy. Octopus not chewy? That's a first for me. It was divine!

Service was cordial and friendly. Dishes came out quickly and all at once. Our table couldn't fit any more food, and neither could our stomachs.

Pinchos was our favorite meal in Kuala Lumpur. I recommended Pinchos to friends on their way to KL, and they loved it too!"
0,Eddie R.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"We found this spot near our hotel. With a Street that's full of restaurants we wanted something light and quick and this place hit the spot. They have a huge selection of wines from all over the world including sangria. They also have several cocktails and a few beers. We had a tortilla Espanola which is pretty good not very authentic but it did it's job served with aioli. The shrimp in garlic was amazing and they brought it out with bread to soak up all the juices and garlic. We also ordered toasted bread with tomato garlic and olive oil, also a win. The restaurant was very chic and well decorated. The staff was friendly and we had an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend the spot for some shared tapas between friends or a couple."
0,Damian W.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Food: 3.5/5.0
Service: 3.5/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0

Solid tapas spot in a central location, but nobody is going to mistake this for Spanish food.  Sampled half the menu plus the rabbit/seafood paella.  Everything was good but nothing struck as being noteworthy.  The paella felt a little better than the tapas."
0,Brandon H.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Was one of three spots I tried while in Changkat Bukit Bintang (Kuala Lumpur). Stopped in for a quick bite and drinks and was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a good mix of tapas and drinks. Managed to try the Patatas Bravas, Sauteed prawns with chili and olive oil and the Meatballs with Bread + Marinara. Portions were a good a size and the drink menu was pretty vast. Food and drink prices are also decent, but could easily tilt towards the expensive end."
0,Michelle B.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Stopped in last night. It appeared most people were there for the drinks. I had Spanish style fried potatoes and fried calamari.  Was not very impressed but it could of just been what ordered. I also had a glass of sangria which was bottled, not made fresh

So I was not impressed by the food nor drink. This was my first night out in KL and I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews."
0,Ian L.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Popular amongst expats and locals alike, in a short span of two years, Pinchos has become somewhat a staple dive bar along Changkat.
   It's a great place for pre-drinks and some tapas before hitting the club. But if you're going to stay, the wines are pretty decent too. Bookings are advisable on weekends."
0,Diana C.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"This is my ultimate favorite restaurant in KL.

I wasn't a big fan of Tapas places until I went to Pincho's. Located in Changkat, it is easy to miss it if you don't have someone who knows the area. There are so many places around that are louder and more appealing. You will have missed out if you don't go.  

Pincho's is a spanish themed place that has the most amazing selection of tapas you can possibly imagine! Some of my (many) favorites are the Beef Skewer with mushrooms, the meat balls and the mushrooms. If you are a fan of prosciutto, you are going to love their Jamon Serrano. They make great sangria and also offer a great selection of wines, beers and whiskeys.

The service is really good, and they offer seating options inside and outside. The place is not too big, so make sure you make reservations if you intend to go with a large group of friends (which is recommendable, since you can order a variety of tapas to share, and everyone gets to taste a bit of everything).

The price is a bit expensive, but totally worth it."
0,Marija S.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Mmmmm Spanish food, Spanish music and Spanish wine..

It almost felt like I was back to Europe for an evening! :)

Guess what dish do you have to try there, once you go? :)
Haha yes TAPAS!

Tasty delicious food, so refreshing! I think in this area it is definitely the highest quality meal you can get!

I would say, be prepared to pay the price, but oh wow it is definitely worth it!

Yummyyy I just wanna go back there right now !

It is my very favourite restaurant In chang kat!

ENJOY!"
0,William D.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"If I had to pick one place as my favorite spot for eating and drinking in KL it would be Pinchos.  Pinchos is the only place that delivers awesomeness every time in every category.  

The tapas here are excellent.  The Serrano ham on toast is to die for.  The roasted mild peppers are fantastic.  The bacon wrapped dates will blow your mind.  

The drinks are worth the money. A gun and tonic is RM32 but you can chose from different gins and specialty tonics. Just ask one of the very knowledgeable bar tenders for help.

My favorite thing about Pinchos is the service. It is so hard to find friendly, intelligent, helpful and attentive service in KL and Pinchos is great every time.  The owners are almost always there making sure everything is running smoothly.  The staff all speak English well and can handle most any dinning issues."
0,Theresa H.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Loved everything about this restaurant. The food, the staff, the decor, the service, the Sangrias, the mixologists. Did I mention the food. Everything was amazing. So crowded on Valentine's it looks like this is a top pick for a lot of people. Which is a very good sign, since there is A LOT of competition in this part of town."
0,Sara M.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"This place just serves the very best food ever! I don't know if I was just hungry but the food was so delicious, my friends and I were heading back from an Orchestra show that night and some friends knew this place and promised us that it's the very best! I joined along and we made this family order where we shared everything and it was heavenly!!

You definitely must try the Gambas al Ajillo which has prawns with garlic and chili and chorizo Con Setas, it has sausage with mushrooms.

The service was good! the staff are happy to help! the seating on the other hand is not the most comfortable and it's quite crowded but if you are engaged in a good conversation then you wouldn't notice!! :)"
0,Emila O.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Good food. Great portions, we had five different Tapas and it was enough for two. Shrimp with chili, mushrooms, bread with tomato(not so exciting), beef and calamari."
0,Bryan S.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Here's a tip. If you ever decide to visit Pinchos, you'd do well to make a reservation earlier in the day as this place has a tendency to fill up very quickly, which one can only take as a good sign. Run by a husband and wife team, Pinchos specializes in Spanish style tapas and while it is definitely on the pricier side, the quality of the food is vindication enough. The spicy chorizo with chunky cubes of potatoes in pure comfort food. Also lookout for the sautéed mushrooms with herbs and the garlicky shrimp tapas. Paella is served here as well and it's the perfect hearty, soulful accompaniment to all the little plates of joy you'll be getting. So yeah, it's not something I'd afford myself on a regular basis, but it's a good place to check out if you're in the mood to spoil yourself and indulge in a really good meal. Or impress your date.  Assuming you have one."
0,Matt D.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,Great food and atmosphere. Wonderful staff. A little expensive but competitive with other up-scale restaurants in Bukit Bintang.
0,Shiao Wenn C.,Onde Onde,"If you're looking for authentic Malaysian food, this is the place for it! The food is amazing, great portion at a reasonable price! The kopi santan is a must try!!"
0,Kris A.,Onde Onde,We happen to walk by by this restaurant after our dinner. The service staff was so friendly that we decided to try their dessert. Excellently done chendol! The taste of Gula Melaka is so tasty and fragrant and the touch of coconut milk is just of the right amount not over powering. So delicious we are going back for their main course!
0,Yeoh J.,Koryo-Won,Good food and nice environment. A bit pricey but this is expected out from this type of premises. Will come back again.
0,Kiran S.,Koryo-Won,"Good location in the basement of the Starhill mall at the JW Marriott in KL-across Bukit Bintang from the Pavilion mall. Good ambience, very welcoming staff. Service and food were superb!  Generous portions; waiter even dissuaded is from over-ordering.Waiter barbecues for you and serves individual meat servings . Classic Korean bbq, superbly done, very delicious! Price is reasonable given quality, a monumental meal for 3 of us, including Soju, cost a total of RM 460.  Kudos to management and staff for running a high class show."
0,Amirul R.,Koryo-Won,"When you're at a Starhill establishment, you expect great food and great service (for a matching lofty price, though.) Koryo-Won is one of my family's favorites. I have never been disappointed by them. The various types of kalbi barbecue here are all fantastic, and the staff are incredibly attentive as they help you cook the food, making sure to keep your side dishes constantly refilled as long as you want. If there's another, better Korean BBQ that also happens to have this sort of high quality ambiance, I don't know it. (Feel free to tell me.)"
0,James L.,The Orchid Conservatory,"Words alone cannot explain how beautiful this place is. It has a hanging garden and orchid scape within a glass atrium located inside Majestic Hotel. I have to say this is the only one of its kind in the country. The orchids on display is heaven for the flower lovers. They are extremely well taken care of with stunning large-petaled blooms. They do change the variety of orchids on display as the seasons progress.

As you can see it's a glass atrium that is very private for your afternoon tea and intimate lunches. You may also book this for private celebratory dinners for up to 15 persons. Do bare in mind that this will not cost less than RM3000 in total."
0,Harvey T.,The Orchid Conservatory,"The Orchid Conservatory at Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur is a very beautiful indoor garden with the sun shining through the glass atrium. This is the best place where you can have your afternoon tea, mini gathering, birthday party or celebrating baby shower here with colorful orchid blooming all over the wall and tables.

The afternoon tea here is similar with what you'll have in the Colonial Cafe and Drawing room, it's just different themes. It's includes hot savories, sandwiches, sweet desserts and scones. However, the price of the afternoon tea having at Orchid Conservatory is more expensive, which is about RM88++ (before GST) per pax. It's start from 3 p.m to 6.30 p.m daily. Due to high demand as it's only fit maximum of 20 person in the room. I will suggest you to do a reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. I haven't get the chance to have the Hi-Tea in Orchid Conservatory yet as I was told by them that I need to wait for 2 months plus upon my reservation. So guys! If you're really interested, please do super early reservation."

For Americans, just a note that its communal seating when it gets busy. If there's an open seat at your table they will seat people there."
0,Fatima B.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"it was worth walking in the blazing hot, humid, heat to eat at this place. extremely cheap (7 MYR = less than $2 USD) for a delicious & decently sized small entree. he ordered the beef ball soup & i ordered the beef slices with dry noodles on the side. both were tasty! the beef balls & beef slices were like nothing we've ever tasted before. definitely something to try for its unique taste. i would recommend this place as a first or last stop to anyone visiting KL.

no air conditioning, but fans good enough to cool you down. cash only."
0,Cheryl H.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"We ordered the ""noodles with chicken "" dish by pointing with our fluent fingers and were delighted.  The food was piping hot, delicious, and the servings were huge, almost more than we could finish...but we forced ourselves. Thick, hot noodles with chunks of chicken all in a spicy sauce that was slurpingly delicious, we needed a fork and spoon to eat it all.  Inexpensive, I think we paid $3 each!  Oh my, it was good!"
0,Consuela P.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Soong Kee, which has been around for a couple of decades, is famed for its beef ball noodles and I grew up eating the dry noodles...still as good as I can remember and undoubtedly best in KL!  

The springy thin Hakka wantan-mee style noodles topped with tasty trademark finely minced meat crowned with the family's secret concoction of rich savory, aromatic mix of herbs and spices and garnished with boiled choi-sum makes this a very intoxicating delicious meal.

Tip: This is one place you must visit but do not expect a super clean stall or a 5 star restaurant."
0,Eileen W.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Great food for a great price. Beef balls are not mainstream in the Asian restaurants I visit back home in the United States.  But now I will look for them, hoping they are as good as these."
0,Wye Mun K.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Awesome beef ball noodles right in the heart of KL.

Another one of the oldest restaurants in KL which serves one of the best beef ball noodles in KL. This business started off as a roadside vendor with at least 50 years of history  and moved into a shop lot.

What's awesome about this place is cause you can choose from Meehoon to Wanton Mee noodles for your beef ball noodles let it be dry or soup!! The chilli sauce is awesome as well!

Be sure to drop by at night as well as they have porridge during the night. They serve steamed chicken along with the porridge which the chicken is very tender and juicy!

0,Nicole S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Soong Kee in my opinion has the best beef ball noodles. I frequent the one at Avenue k and its just as authentic and as good as the original restaurant that opened ages ago. I like how the quality has been maintained, the beef balls are still beefy and yummy and has a firm texture but is not hard. The noodles are springy and has that perfect consistency.

I definitely will go back to Soong Kee anytime i crave for beef ball noodles because no where else can make it the same."
0,Julian T.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"My dad has been bringing me here since I was a kid and everytime I visit it now and then, it brings back the old memories. Having said that, Soong Kee has been operating for a very long time. I've had many other beef ball noodles and there was never one that can beat the original taste this place has.

The beef here is full of flavor and taste. Be it the minced beef, beef ball, or beef strips, they are all delicious. I always add on some extra minced beef because of how good it taste with the noodles. Prices here have increased, but the quality has never been compromised."
0,T. H. S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Surrounded by business buildings, Soong Kee serves the best beef noodle and pork mince noodle in the center of the busy KL city. Their price is also relatively low. You can definitely have a satifying lunch/dinner with just below 10 ringgit per. I don't eat beef, but all of my friends and colleagues who had it before loved it instantly and now visiting the restaurant regularly. Their chilli sauce is great too! They also serve porridge at night time. It's not very spacious though, so it's a perfect place for a quick lunch."
0,Marie S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Highly recommended if you like good food and don't care about about appearance. You won't be disappointed with their food! Recommended items are:  beef ball noodles, steamed chicken and iced lemon tea."
0,Annabelle Y.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Located in the hear of KL, it's hard to miss this kopitiam. As you probably guess from the signage, it's the beef ball noodles that make it happen here. It's packed every day especially at lunch hour but thankfully the space is air-conditioned so you can eat comfortably. Ordering is a breeze as well because all you gotta do is choose a bowl size depending how hungry you are. It comes with springy Hakka noodles topped with minced meat and choy sum. One thing about beef noodles is the sauce and of course, Soong Kee makes their own and it's a secret but who cares? It's above par! Not only that, the beef balls that accompany it has the elasticity of well beaten meat, very satisfying on the palate. Or if you're craving for chicken, do try the Lao You Ji located right in front of Soong Kee. Customer turnover rate is high here so I suggest taking those long catch up sessions elsewhere, coffee after lunch perhaps?=)"
0,Bryan S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"I've been visiting this place since I was a kid, when dad used to take us here for dinner and has always been a go to place for my relatives whenever they come over for visits from the States. I have to admit, my recent visits have left me a little disappointed. The beef noodle portions were smaller and the prices were higher. Goddammit inflation. They were also stingier with their minced pork. On the brightside the beef ball soup is still in my opinion one of the best around. The beef strips are unbelievably tender, that even after years of loyal patronage, me and family still rave about how it just melts whenever we're eating it."
0,Nick H.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I stayed at the hostel which is basically connected to TG's - every morning I had the roti canai with teh tarik for breakfast and it was honestly just perfect.

lovely flaky roti canai with a light curry on the side. The pulled tea was never too sweet or too astringent. The guys here are pretty nice and speak english fairly well as well.

I did also have a chicken & cheese murtabak for lunch here as well which was quite decent - lots of chicken but a little short on flavor. Would be perfect for someone who's grown a bit weary of strong curries and flavors. Quite filling and a fair price."
0,Ed T.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I came back recently, twice.

Last year I remember half the meals weren't available until after 12pm, so this time I came at 12:30. However, most of the items I wanted were STILL not available, and when I asked they said ""after 130pm"". This was really frustrating, because I had limited time in KL.

However, I did walk by the next day, at dinner time, and finally all the menu items were available. I got the naan, roti, and the murtabak (described as a pancaked stuffed with cheese but I'd say it's more like a naan and a quesadilla had a baby) and all three were really, really good. The naan and roti were really soft and some of the best I've ever had, and the murtabak is the first and only one I've ever seen but certainly I'll be looking for this from now on.

The lesson is, only come here when it's dark."
0,Hannah E.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"A simple muttar paneer and roti canai was all I was craving at the end of a kind of stressful day filled with hot, sunny walking on the edges of freeways. Tg's could choose to capitalize on the fact that it's located in backpacker row and charge more than MYR 8-9 for that set meal, but it doesn't, and thanks for that!

Really creamy paneer and ghee visibly trickling and pooling atop the thicker curry like watercolor on paper make this a delight to look at and to eat."
0,Rod M.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"One of our major objectives upon arriving in Kuala Lumpur was to eat as much roti as possible.  We experimented with a few spots, but TG's was the clear winner. We visited them every morning for our roti canai breakfast and loved every bite.

The roti at TG's is made fresh to order, which I think is one of their key's to success. It is also wonderfully flaky and tender. Truly just right! It is accompanied by a great curry which you can sop up with your roti.  

TG's has a complete menu of other times, most of which we did not try, too focused on the roti. We did have some veggies and enjoyed a number of their fresh fruit juices, coffees and teas. The mango lassi and pineapple juice were big hits."
0,Chang L.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"This was actually one of the best meals I had in Kuala Lumpur. I found TG's on Yelp, of course. I found the service to be polite, the options plentiful, and the food delicious. Servings are smaller than typical Indian restaurant, or at least lunch portions, but we are just chubby Americans complaining. The owner/manager made some great recommendations for a variety of dishes to order and we enjoyed them all. One note: didn't like the ""lassi"", it was more like a smoothie. Great find overall!"
0,Alice T.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Solid Indian food. It's an open-air restaurant near Jalan Alor. Lots of seating. You can also see the buffet of curries available as well as someone making fresh roti.

We had:
- Lamb biryani with vegetables (18RM). Served as overcooked biryani rice with a side of lamb curry, rather than lamb cooked into the rice. Two solid vegetable sides (looks like vegetables-of-the-day) of cabbage and marinated squash. Lamb was very tender. Curry was buttery, but not at the same spice level of really delicious Indian food.
- Ikan (fish) curry with 2 vegetables (9RM). Served with lots of rice, a thick fish steak on top of the rice, curry on the side, and two vegetable sides of bean sprouts and green beans. The white fish was flavorful and not dry. Watch out for bones. The curry paired well with the fish and rice, but wasn't mind-blowing. All of the food was also lukewarm.
- Roti canai (1.20RM). Yum! Fresh roti that was light and easy to scarf down. Served with dahl (lentils) that was pretty mediocre.
- Mango lassi (6RM). Less yogurty, more like a mango and pineapple smoothie. Still refreshing.
- Pulled tea/teh tarik with ice (2.50RM). Good! Not too sweet like I was expecting. Smooth taste with a strong tea flavor."
0,Karine K.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Very reasonable and tasty food, especially for breakfast.
Drinks are a little too sweet for me. Had to ask to put less sugar in mine.
Our favorite was double cheese roti."
0,Anthony C.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I lived down the street from this place as well as the central night market area... Wow! The BEST mango lassi.  I even got it to go a few times and always had it when I was eating there.  The roti is excellent and you can see them making it right then and there.  The dosa is pretty well done as well!  Their curries are flavorful as well as the sauces that come with the roti.  I also enjoyed their roti canai (I think?) which is roti, cut up and then fried as if it was a stir fried noodle dish.  A must stop by if you're in the area!!"
0,Richard R.,TG's Nasi Kandar,It's located on a back street and has a modest appearance but the food stands out as exceptional and a great value.  We went for dinner but breakfast is served as well.  My wife had all vegetarian but I had a chicken dish.  We just loved it.
0,Muzzamil D.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Lamb, Chicken, Garlic Roti, Papper Dossi (Masala Dossa), Fresh Juice, & The best butter honey Nan ever! Amazing Service! Great place and people!"
0,Linh B.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"A good Malaysian eatery in the center of the city! The price is very cheap (6 MYR for a cool fresh coconut, 11-14 MYR for main dish and 1-3 MYR for add-on veggies) compared to restaurants in the mall. I am not a fan of Malaysian food but this place isworths a try"
0,Abraham M.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"The place is basic, but the food is really great! Their best plate is Roti, but all the food is very delicious! We asked also a cold coconut an tea tharik is awesome! Simply the best place to eat Malayan and Indian food"
0,Matt S.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Excellent roti, super cheap and fast friendly service. We tried a couple of different types of roti and weren't disappointed. Easy to find location. Would recommend it to anyone and would go back"
0,Byron L.,TG's Nasi Kandar,Very good bread. Naan roti and all the possible breads available are very good. Curry and sides that come with the breads are decent. This place has a very street vibe. Price is good.
0,Flag S.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Indian and ""local Indian"" cuisine. Cheap, good cheap juices too. A great quick stop before/after nearby jalan alor night food market. Quality, tasty and open 24h. What more would anyone want?"
0,Burhan H.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Everytime i have work around KL i'd always stop by for lunch here. The space is cozy and the service is wonderful. Theres a motel for travelers within restaurant so you'll probably see alot of foreigners here too. Let's talk about food. They have the usual 'mamak' food like roti canai and such but i never got to try them. Instead i usually have their rice with their currys. Love it. One thing to highlight though is that if you're coming over by car, its not really easy to find a parking space here at lunch time on weekdays (12pm-2pm). The price is also reasonable as i usually hv to pay around rm12 for a plate of rice with chicken, veggies, curry and a drink."
0,Karla C.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"not many reviews for this place on yelp but has been rated #1 on trip advisor. this may have been my most enjoyable meal while in KL even after visiting the street food market. i enjoyed the authenticity of the meal, ambiance, the service was quick and very inexpensive after converting CAD$. location was really easy to find as long as you have google maps."
0,Dor R.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"TG's is delicious, inexpensive, authentic Indian/Malaysian/Thai food. Garlic chicken and butter chicken are tasty. Try the crispy roti as a dessert! Will definitely be back with my family."
0,Nicole S.,113 Food Court,"113 food court is one of the best Chinese food courts near me. I say this because there are so many stalls at least 30-40 stalls and all selling different types of foods and some that you can't get at other food courts.  This food court is also very big, airy and clean. Service as usual at food courts is good and you get your drinks fast.

The prices are normal food court prices and my favorite food here is the chicken wings, the kolok mee, the wantan mee, bak kut teh. Everything here is good and definitely worth a visit. Parking is not easy though especially on weekday evenings. You can hardly get parking inside, so you have to park along the road."
0,Danny S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"A shroud of darkness envelops me, and the sense I've relied on so heavily since inception becomes numb.

I hold onto the shoulders of my guide, creating a human train like we used to create back in kindergarden: oh how glorious those days were. Woe is me!

Now, the belly of the beast has completely consumed me, and I have no choice but to play fiddle to its mighty beat.

The bouncy flesh of my booty thankfully finds a chair that welcomes it, and I have to grab blindlessly at the table to locate a fork, spoon, and the vodka on the rocks I had ordered.

My transformation into a half-wolf, half-husky has made considerable progress and my sense of smell, taste, hearing, and touch are enhanced from the death of vision.

Each course and dish is a blindfolded experiment- a true delight to the senses!

My jaw chomps down on I don't even know what but I know I like what I'm tasting.

""I'll have what I'm having!!!"" I loudly think to myself.

After the last morsel is consumed, I human-train with my guide back to reality and finally I see the light."
0,Erin P.,Dining In The Dark KL,"This is the best restaurant I have visited since I arrived in Asia 3 weeks ago. The food was phenomenal and the experience was truly unique. I have never experienced anything like it before but I hope I am able to again. The staff did a great job preparing us for the meal so that we were not scared going into the dining room, and the darkness experts were extremely kind and helpful. The food was also so tasty and I wish I could have eaten more of it. The portions were the perfect size and I was extremely satisfied after the meal. Overall a 10/10 experience that I would highly recommend to anyone in Kuala Lumpur. Such an amazing meal!"
0,Jen L.,Dining In The Dark KL,"I heard this place in social media and that everyone was commenting,  it was a great experienced and what made me curious is how you eat in the dark? So i bought a Groupon for Rm75 they waived Rm150 which is a pretty good deal.

I went the other day and i really love the friendly vibe welcoming me with a complimentary cocktail drink and we needed to guess the drink - not going to tell you if not you will know the answer. this is test your sense of taste. Another game was to find 4 safety pins in a small bowl of rice and it took me 10 minutes. This is to test your sense of touch and another game is when your partner is blindfolded and need to fix back shapes to a board with your guidance - sense of hearing.

Then  we were ready to go inside, my heart was full of excitement, we dont even know what is the food being served, a blind man escorted us in the pitch black dark place and brought us to our seats. My partner was trying to figure out where we were going and being seated. Our appetizer was served in 4 small pates on a board and in a pitch black room, my hands was more focused touching and feeling the bowl before i eat with my hands. My eyes tends to automatically close in the dark without me realizing. Soup came in 2 small cups - a mushroom soup and parsnip soup. Then the main course came in 3 small plate which was lobster with pineapple sauce, slice octopus with apple cinamon sauce and i forgot the other one. I love the the mash potatoes! I could tell you the menu because they changed it every month. Then the dessert came in 4 plates and 1 small cup which was the jackfruit ice cream.  

I honestly love the food as it tested our sense of test in different flavours such as parsnip, the lavender creme brulee, the apply cinammon sauce and the jackfruit ice cream. I never talked in the dark before while eating and it feels weird, feels like your talking alone. I never had a 3 plates of main course food to eat before!

What a great experience and after you come out from the dark, you will be given a feedback form and a look at the food menu. I met the manager and he explained the concept and all. Really interesting place.

P:S: You might want to bring more money here. Just the 4 course meal cost RM236 excluding other chargers and drinks, luckily they waived off RM150 if not my partner needs to pay RM300 for 2 pax."
0,Nadia S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"We wanted to try something a little different for our anniversary dinner and I'm glad that chose to have dinner at Dining in The Dark. Prior to the visit, I had heard mixed reviews on the place, but decided to go anyway.

We actually couldn't find the place at first as it is situated on the first floor, amidst other establishments. The signage leading up to the restaurant is quiet, unassuming yet full of promise, a precursor of the dining experience that we were about to have,

As the place requires you to reserve your spot in advance, they knew who we were as soon as we walked in. I thought that was a nice touch. First, we played a little game of find the paperclips in a cocktail glass of rice. Would have been easy had we not been blindfolded. It was surprisingly tough and really helped to make us realise how difficult it must be to go through life blind.

After the game (which was accompanied by a welcome drink), we were introduced to our wait staff for the night, a nice lady who was medically blind. She was very gentle as she told us to hang on to her shoulder as we descended into the darkness. Honestly, I was a little freaked out initially, but I was amazed at how my sense of hearing seemed to sharpen in the presence of darkness. My sense of touch seemed to be on hypermode too.

The highlight, however, was the food. It was beyond delicious. The chef knew his food chemistry alright. It is difficult to explain how it felt like to eat in the dark. When I told some people about it, their reaction was, ""Just turn off the light at home and eat la!"". A little simplistic but then again, this experience is probably better suited for the more curious type.

We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It really helped to build empathy for the visually impaired, and amplified our gratitude for the sense of sight!"
0,Elizabeth S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Such a fun experience. We stayed just up the street and passed it several time. It sounded like a bit of a gimmick until I noticed it had one of the higher ratings of any restaurant in KL. My husband was fascinated by the clicks the servers made to alert each other of their presence and still tells our friends the story of our meal, 2 years later! The food was delicious, and I found that I'm terrible at discerning individual flavors, but it was a fun date spent trying to decipher each one. The waiters were kind and I felt extraordinarily humbled by experiencing for a couple hours what they experience every day as a blind person. Thanks for such a memorable time!"
0,Ian L.,Dining In The Dark KL,"You get the gist. Basically, the restaurant requires diners to sit in a pitch-black restaurant.
   The menu is pre-set. So, before heading in the restaurant, you have no idea what you're going to eat. The menu was only revealed at the end of the night. We were blindfolded at the door and led by blind staff.  After taking our seats, staff explained the setting of table.
   The meal arrived promptly as we savor the dishes in pitch black environment. Half-way through, my partner couldn't take it and left. It was a dining experience so strange that I find it once is more than enough."
0,Ida S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Service is very friendly and nice, and I enjoyed the beginning of the dinner. However it gets kind of boring after a couple of courses since there is no visual stimuli, darkness doesn't provoke conversation and at the end of the meal I just kept waiting for something to happen. Food is just alright, a couple of dishes are very tasty and others not at all. Still, it's always fun to try something new, but I think once is enough."
0,Benjamin S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Dining in the Dark is a dining experience that I feel everyone should go through at least once in their life. It is a real eye opener - no pun intended.

I bought my girlfriend to this restaurant and when we first reached the restaurant they invited us to play a simple game where you are required to find a number of paper clips in a container of rice while being blindfolded; I found it extremely difficult and took a long time to find it.  My girlfriend on the other hand was surprisingly good at this game and managed to find all the paper clips in a way shorted time than me - impressive! After that we were led into the actual dining area and to our table by one of the waiters where it is completely pitch black. We were served shortly and then taught by the waiter some of the rules of locating our utensils or glasses in the dark and also how to eat when you cannot see anything. The experience was amazing and I would find doing day to day activities really hard; I could never seem to locate where my mouth is. Finally, when we were done through all the courses, we were led out once more by the waiter and asked to guess the food that we had. As I am not an expert on food, I only managed to guess one or two correct- terrible, i know!

However, it is a bit costly at RM150 per person, but it is an experience worth feeling as it really helped me to appreciate life more and whatever we are gifted with. Also, I have to mention that the waiters there are blind and it is really touching to see how passionate they are at what they're doing."
0,Julie Y.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Nervous thoughts filled my head as I lounged outside Dining in the Dark, the first of its kind in KL. All I knew was that in a few minutes, I will be led inside a pitch-black restaurant and will be having my meal in the dark with other strangers. The preset menu will not be revealed until the meal is over to maintain the element of surprise. This unique concept was introduced by restaurateur Werner Kuhn who wanted to bring his guests on a gastronomic journey focusing on purely the other senses except for sight. The service staff consists of visually impaired and blind waiters who will lead and guide the tasting session.

I was ordered to store away any mobile phones or watches beforehand in the lockers provided to ensure that there will be no light inside the room. Dutifully, I lined up alongside a handful of other strangers and placed my hands on the shoulder of the person in front of me. A blind waiter greeted us and proceeded to lead the group inside the pitch-black restaurant while constantly reminding us not to let go in case we get stranded. The first step inside the dark room immediately stripped us of our sight and proved to be too much to handle for some as the girl behind me let out a yelp and ran off into the opposite direction as fear took over. I took a nervous gulp and continued on.

The restaurant did a great job at ensuring every single inch of light was covered as I could not make out anything and it was terrifying. Slowly the waiters led us one by one to our tables, as we struggled to find our seats and we were briefed on where each cutlery was located at in front of us. Thankfully, there were no knives in place as that could be a catastrophe. Only chatter could be heard as strangers seated together conversed to ease the tension. Let's just say this may not be a good place to bring a date as there is no escape route though it forced people to chat instead of occupying themselves with their gadgets.

The waiters clearly knew their way around as sight wasn't an issue to them since they were already used to being visually impaired. Though it was a three course meal, it was one of the longest meal of my life as time seemed to slow down with the absence of sight. I picked at my food slowly while stabbing what I could on the plate with my fork though it was a little hard to pinpoint at the rubbery texture in my mouth. There was also a surprise piano performance halfway throughout our meal by a talented blind pianist which made us appreciate our sight even more. At the end of the meal, we were lined up again and led out of the room much to our relief. There was a good laugh around the room as our meal was revealed to us. Though the Dining in the Dark experience was a unique one, my first visit will definitely not warrant a second one as the food was mediocre as the focus was clearly more on the entire experience."
0,Lisa H.,Dining In The Dark KL,"This is a wonderful experience for many reasons. Our guide AK was delightful, attentive and a great instructor. We were most pleased with the appetizer course but all were tasty. There was a little more sauce then we prefer on the entree selections. Some of the desserts were not preferable for our sweet tooth. The concept is genuinely unique and teaches you to focus on senses a sighted person is not as aware of. The human side of relating to a blind persons challenged is heightened which leads to greater awareness and appreciation for gifts we take fir granted. Way more than a dining experience. Thank you!"
0,Bryan S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Dining the dark is all about the often repeated notion that the loss of one sense is compensated with the enhancement of our other senses hence crafting a dining experience unlike any other. Personally, I found it to be a harrowingly hilarious experience more so than an orgasmic culinary escapade of the senses. The words Pitch black is an understatement in describing the form of vision you have here. Journeying to the fancy side of dining is usually one that doesn't often excite me with its small portions and supposedly world class crafted menu, which I have to say in terms of food isn't totally wrong about dining in the dark with its standard menu that changes every week. However what makes this dining exploit worth those extra Ringgits, is the experience and that is what you're paying for. Whether with a friend or that special someone, the memory of Dining in the dark will no doubt be forever engraved in your mind."
0,Martin M.,Madam Kwan's,"If you're a foreigner visiting Kulai Lumpar, you can't go wrong with Madam Kwan's. Everything is decently priced and you can feast like a king (drink + appetizer + main course + dessert) for around $7 - $8 US a person.

I'm not sure how the Nasi Lemak fares against other local joints but it was the best Nasi Lemak I had while in my stay in Malaysia. The rice was super rich and buttery, and the meat was extremely flavorful.

I had to also order Kee Twao since it resembles one of my favorite Chinese comfort foods growing up - Chow Fun. It tastes similar but it definitely has more spice and kick to it than what we Chinese put into it.

Their drinks are also a must-get. Ask the servers for recommendations, we tried 5 different drinks and they were all good."
0,Gary Y.,Madam Kwan's,"Oh my nasi bojari! Madam Kwan's has some really tasty stuff for a reasonable price. 120 RM for 2 mains, one veggie dish, and a set of combo satay (the sauce was excellent). Definitely get the nasi bojari if you have to pick between that and nasi lemak. While the nasi lemak was good, nasi bojari is superior in every aspect down to the rice. Definitely didn't regret taking a chance at this place."
0,Angelo B.,Madam Kwan's,"It's a nice restaurant serving tasty Malay food. I'm pretty sure this is more expensive than most of the other Malay places. But I felt it was worth the money, and actually still very cheap compared to US price levels.

The beef rendang was delicious, and the beef was cooked well.

Curry laksa was good. Also nice was the curry chicken skewers.

I'd recommend against the mocktails. They are not worth the premium over the regular drinks. For example the only difference between the lychee drink and the lychee lemon mocktail (except the price) was that the lychee lemon drink also comes with a slice of lemon!"
0,M M.,Madam Kwan's,"Sitting at one of the most prestigious mall in Kuala Lumpur, the place is pretty crowded.  The food,  mixed satay , the dipping sauce is amazing.  The noddle dishes are also pretty decent."
0,Nicole N.,Madam Kwan's,"This place is really popular but I feel like the quality of food went down. The sauce and plates we got were not as vibrant as we had hoped for. A lot of it seemed a bit over cooked, over priced and the portions also seem tiny."
0,Elee J.,Madam Kwan's,"I think I got the Beef Rendang. Whatever it was, it was the best meal I had during my short stay in Malaysia.

The meat was flavorful.  The rice was so good I had to order an extra side to eat with the meat.

Place is located inside KLCC.  So if you are planning to visit the Petronas Towers, definitely give this place a try for local cuisine.  It's not fancy and it is rather small, but that is all made up for in the great tasting food."
0,Sylvia K.,Madam Kwan's,"This place is located on the 4th floor of the (air-conditioned) Suria KLCC Mall inside the Petronas Towers Building. A friend of mine recommended this place for its nasi lemak. We went around 6pm on a Thursday evening and didn't have to wait for a table.

There was a lot to choose from the menu, but we ordered the nasi lemak (since it came highly recommended) as well as the curry laksa. The food came out quickly. The nasi lemak was good! The coconut rice and curry part was delicious. The chicken was just a tad dry. It also came with what they call shrimp floss and anchovies with some kind of sauce and a hard boiled egg. The curry laksa was yummy. I liked the noodles and the broth and the veggies and tofu were good. Again, the chicken meat was dry.

The place has a nice ambience and is very clean. The service was good when we got it - there were a lot of servers on staff but sometimes it was hard to get their attention, like when we wanted to order or when we wanted to get the check - had to flag someone down. By the time we left, the restaurant (which is pretty big) was full and there were people waiting outside!"
0,Hans D.,Madam Kwan's,"This place was great! We just had a business meeting in the Petronas Twin Towers and since we were only in KL for one day, something proper Malay was high on our agenda. We had the Nasi Lemak, Nasi Bojari, Malay Satay, Otak-Otak, and some Assam Prawns. All of this for a business lunch at the ridiculously cheap price of €45 for three people ..."
0,Will W.,Madam Kwan's,"Fine dining at the mall seems to be a thing in Asia. Well I liked it, its a dressed up fancier version of food you'd get on the street. This would be a good place to take people who are want to try the local foods, but are hesitant to eat street food (their loss I know.) Anyway the service was good and the food was quite good. I had a very nice Laksa here, the broth was hot and it packed some heat in the spice department. So much so that my Vietnamese friend tapped out and couldn't handle more than two bites. I thought the beef rendang was a bit dry but still serviceable. Excellent Nasi Lemak, the mix of textures and flavors in the dish were spot on. They make a great Barley Ice as well.

I preferred the street food on Jalan Alor, but I don't mind this place at all."
0,Peter D.,Madam Kwan's,"Since I'm a sucker for Mall Chinese Food, I thought I might as well try some Mall Malaysian Food.

I was hoping to tuck into some curry laksa, or perhaps the nasi lemak. However, my wife doesn't care at all what I want, and so we got the appetizer sampler (Madam's Starters for 2) with the intention of ordering more afterward. Other than the mildly interesting but ultimately underwhelming otak-otak, it was solid fried food that could really have been served anywhere in the world. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to go out of your way for.*

Unfortunately, the service leaves much to be desired. Maybe chain spots are the same throughout the world, but our servers took a cue from my wife, and really couldn't have cared less about me and anything I wanted (i.e. a menu, drinks, more food, a check, etc.).

So we just left and ate more street food, which was probably for the best anyway.

*We should've gotten the curry laksa, wife. Why must you always ruin my life?"
0,Joann Y.,Madam Kwan's,"In Kuala Lumpur for the weekend and wanted to try Malaysian food! Since our group was quite large, it proved to be a bit hard to eat together at a market, which I would have liked, so Madam Kwan's was the best option!

We had the beef rendang, nasi lemak, fried rice, curry laksa, and some drinks. I will say the food was nice. It wasn't the best that I've never had but it was good. The curry laksa had noodles that were too soft for my taste. I prefer noodles al dente, but tasty overall! I actually really enjoyed the beef rendang. The meat was nice and tender like pulled pork! Portions aren't humongous by the way, which was good for us. What was different about the fried rice was that there was dried fish in it. Not good for those who don't like seafood though!

The service was okay. I understand that restaurants in Malaysia are sit, eat, and go. We did not fulfill that requirement so I'm sure we took up too much time in there! But with a party of 6 this restaurant was able to accommodate us all. For that, thanks Madam Kwan's!

Overall, this restaurant was good, but not exceptional. The combination of the nice interior, decent price, alright service, and good food earned it 4 stars from me."
0,Maylan B.,Madam Kwan's,"It was our first time in Malaysia and we were looking for authentic cuisine. We ended up here. The place was full when we walked in. The host was attentive and got us seated right away.

The ambiance was welcoming. Decor were eye catching, the ones that make you feel like you're in the right place.

We ordered Laksa Soup and a chicken dish and shaved ice. The food was fresh, the portions were filling. It's only 3 stars because we asked for mild level of spiciness but the Laksa soup burns you mouth. I wish they could adjust this as not everyone have high tolerance to spicy food.

It was a memorable experience overall. Thank you Malaysia."
0,Jacob V.,Madam Kwan's,First the food was actually quite good. Tasty and exceptional. However the service is probably the worst. The server Kelly appeared to be irritated when we asked for anything. Another male server also forgot to bring extra glasses and showed his displeasure. I felt horrible about the service and sad for this service given to fellow Malaysians.
0,David P.,Madam Kwan's,"Enjoyed a nice filling and very tasty dinner at Madam Kwan's in Kuala Lumpur. Started with the mixed Malaysian Satay, the peanut sauce was fantastic, I was scraping the bowl at the end. For the main course I went for the large and delicious Nasi Bojari, rice was super flavorful, chicken tender, prawns with nice spice and the beef smooth and silky. Service was very efficient and friendly, they deal with the large throughput of guests very well. I recommend for a nice meal in KL!"
0,DD C.,Madam Kwan's,"Madam Kwan's is at a decent location inside Suria KLCC Mall. We would like to taste classic Malaysian food but could not endure the street stands under hot sun, humid and sweaty air. Madam Kwan's setting  would meet our desire.  We ordered Malaysian Satay Mix (馬來式串燒, $5.20, a classic and tasty Satay meat); Nasi Bojari (關姐三色飯, $7.20; a house specialty with an interesting combination of chicken leg, shred pork meat and seafood, came along with a ball of ""3-color rice"") ; and Rice-coconut (椰香飯, $0.93; in case that there's not enough rice for 2 hungry people). We also ordered a Red Bean Ice (紅豆冰 $2.40; for nostalgic reason). Hot Chinese Tea, costed $1.65, was flavorsome. We enjoyed the first dinner in Kuala Lumpur."
0,Johnny Z.,Madam Kwan's,"Normal traditional Malay restaurant, nothing special, wouldn't come again or recommend it"
0,Naz H.,Madam Kwan's,"I was looking forward to a meal out here with my family of 9. We were here for opening fast during Ramadan.

At first, things were looking decent - food initially came out quick and then, half of our dishes never came in. Despite numerous talks to rectify the situation with a couple of different servers, the dishes just never came for a good half hour. By then, most of everyone who had food, had finished or just about finished.

When the dishes finally came (three orders of the Mushroom Chicken Rice - which should be one of the simplest dishes), my mother's order was pink: RAW.

And even the dishes that did arrive - well, if you've had local food anywhere at a homemade style place, or at a hawker stall, well, Madam Kwan's is overhyped, overpriced and far from authentic."
0,Anna A.,Madam Kwan's,"Madam Kwan's in KLCC is easily one of the busiest restaurants in the whole mall. Every day during lunch hour you will find the place packed and people waiting in line outside. They even have a waiting area outside their store since they have grown so accustomed to huge crowds! But fret not, usually the wait is about 20 minutes and then you get a table as their staff is very efficient so the second a table is available, they will clean it and get the next party seated.

Food here is typical Malaysian and you will find items like Char Koay Teow, Nasi Lemak, Satay and Otak-otak among others. Apparently, this restaurant was the brainchild of one actual Madam Kwan who came up with all of the dishes.

For me, the food here is alright but the prices are just exorbitant! I quite enjoy their Char Koay Teow and Hokkien Noodles as well as their Banana Fritters with ice cream for dessert (so so good!) but otherwise find it too expensive for typical Malaysian dishes. Service is excellent though, I have to say. I am impressed that their staff are trained so well."
0,Nicole S.,Madam Kwan's,"Okay, Madam Kwan's is by far my all time favorite Malaysian restaurant. So excited to be reviewing this place. I love everything on the menu but like many of the frequent patrons, i always opt for either the nasi lemak or nasi bojari. Sometimes i cant decide so me and daddy order one of each and share share. This way we get to eat both! For dessert i either have the super delicious cendol or the sago gula melaka. Both equally sweet and satisfying. I've been to many of the outlets and the food is standard all over, i appreciate this fact because you dont want your favorite nasi lemak tasting different at different outlets.

My favorite outlet is at Pavilion. Why? Cause Madam Kwan herself is there most days. Yes, yes the real Madam Kwan, as in the lady you see on the menu. She's so cute and humble, she greets you as you enter her restaurant and even seats you to your table. Was super starstruck the first time i saw her and told her she made the best nasi lemak ever!

As for pricing, to me its reasonable but i know some people (my boyfriend) that find it pricey for usual hawker food. He doesn't understand why he has to pay rm15 for a plate of fried rice when he can get it for rm5 at a hawker stall. Well to each their own."
0,Ian L.,Madam Kwan's,"Famous for their local cuisine, Madam Kwan is an institution. Serving Malaysian food in a high-end setting (read: clean, modern), Madam Kwan has a few outlets across the town.
    You will find their standout dishes like Nasi Lemak and Nasi Beroja as well as other local delicacies like Ipoh hor fun, laksa, deep fried squid and beef rendang. There are all delicious and well-prepared. If you dine at their Pavilion outlet, sometimes you would even spot Madam Kwan herself! (yes, she is real).
   Well, to be honest, you can find similiar food (if not better) in your warung or other restaurants. At Madam Kwan's you pay more for the ambience, service and setting. And some reasons, this seems to be a very popular choice for Singapore tourists."
0,Sin Yee Y.,My Burger Lab,"Believe it or not, myBurger Lab is where I have my first burger in my life! This place is always packed yet it worths your time to queue for the most delicious burger in the world!

If you have not been having any burger from myBurger Lab, you probably have seen some photos of it. Yes, the black bun caught my attention!

There are a lot of choices, chicken, beef and vegetarian burgers are served. Order it in a la carte, or make it a set with extra RM7.50z You will get free flow soft drink and a side.

My all-time-flavor is Chicken Say Cheese while Danny's one is Beef Beautiful Mess. We normally order one a la carte and one set. Trust us, both are full! We share our side and drink which able to make it an awesome dinner!

Yes, you can only have it from 5.30pm onwards. I seriously wish they can consider to open in the morning, or at least, afternoon!

Btw, I heard that OUG branch queue isn't as bad as Seapark. You probably can think of coming OUG branch. ;)"
0,Brendan L.,My Burger Lab,"Good food, Great service.

Staff is very well trained, all with great, freindly personality - something you are not very used to in Malaysian eateries, outside of fine dining."
0,Jasmine C.,My Burger Lab,"This is the branch I frequent most of all due to accessibility reasons. On weekends the crowd can be quite overwhelming but the servers are usually on hand to help with seating and organising the queue. However, I am not too fond of how close the tables are placed to each other. I would enjoy talking to my friend more if I didn't have to keep raising my voice above the conversations of the neighboring tables. However, if you are dining alone, the neighboring conversations can keep you entertained while waiting.

The burgers are the reason we keep coming back! Juicy, well-grilled/well-fried patties with inventive pairings! My current favourite is the Bait & Switch burger with features budu sauce! I love it when Malaysian ingredients are featured! These two evenings we had the Geisha (Wakame, Japanese kyuri cucumbers and chicken patty with sesame dressing), Spicy Hawaiian (Chicken burger with pineapple and their famous red sauce) and a special customised vegan burger.

They are currently offering two sides, fries and mash, so we usually go for the fries as it's really tasty with the red sauce!

Love that they still keep coming up with new burgers! Always check out their social media for new inventions, which usually comes with an introductory discount! :)"
0,Steph S.,My Burger Lab,"The line was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it! The first time I went here, they were closed, so I was sooo happy to catch them when they are open. I had fun making my own lab burger creation and chatting with the cooks. My friend who came with me is vegetarian, and she really appreciated the options My Burgerlab had for her. All in all, delicious!"
0,Penny W.,My Burger Lab,"Thankfully, Burgerlab opened a few branches and it is no longer super packed. I can still remember the queue was so long, people were queuing outside the shop. I visited both Seapark and OUG branch before and I prefer the OUG branch because parking isn't much of a hassle and there are less people even on weekend.

I've tried a few burgers before and so far, the best is The Hulk but they don't always have it. The portion for The Hulk is HUGE, hence the name.  Plus they have avocado in it too. Yumyum. The hands down weirdest burger is BlueBlack (Only available in OUG, if I'm not mistaken) Blue cheese is used in BlueBlack and when I took a bite of it, my taste buds went next level but it did not stop there ... Since it tasted weird, so I ate it with tomato sauce and oh my, believe it or not, it tasted like apple! Say whatttttt! My friends and I were freaking amazed by the combination.

They changed their fries a few months ago and I prefer the previous one. The sauce that accompanies the fries is really good too but it can be quite spicy."
0,Julie Y.,My Burger Lab,"I started coming to the OUG branch when the Seapark branch was getting too crowded and the one hour wait was ridiculous. I like how service is always efficient here as they actually have staff to come up to you and brief you about their menu to help you make your choice.

Their burgers are still the best i've tried among all the other burger places as their patty is juicy and moist sandwiched in between soft charcoal buns with yummy lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms. My favourite is the A+ burger as its the best of the lot and most appealing to me.

Their fries are also generously flavoured with herbs and the dip is excellent, you'll be asking for seconds. The wait at the OUG branch isn't as bad as Seapark so i rather come here."
0,Edmond Y.,My Burger Lab,"Best burgers hands down! I've been a burger eater since I could eat with my fingers at 2 years old and these burgers are crafted with real care. I've tried a few different burger selections here and their flavours are all very well balanced. It's not just burgers, it's burgers made with care.

Not cheap, but with burgers so mouth watering, the stomach trumps the wallet."
0,Intan N.,My Burger Lab,"In my previous post I have compared KGB to Burger lab and said that KGB is the winner of the two burger joints.

To this day, I still believe that KGB has the upper hand. For instance Burger lab has a self-pick up system which I do not appreciate since the prices are about the same as KGB. Burger lab's location is a bit less accessible and the parking is horrendous if you go during the peak hours.

Although that is just my opinion, some people like the different take of Burger lab's burgers. The only thing I like about them is that their cheese is crispy instead which I think is interesting. Though if you do want to check this place out I suggest the Elvis burger not on the menu anymore it is a peanut butter burger, it sounds strange but oddly one of those thing you either love or hate"
0,Julian T.,My Burger Lab,"I wrote about he Seapark outlet before this, but I'll like to talk about this outlet here in OUG as there is a little difference. People who never got the chance to visit the Burgerlab in Seapark would not know that the menu here is more limited. There are a few choices that aren't available in OUG. The ones that are available however, still carries the delicious tag from the original outlet.

The burgers here are as good, sometimes tasting better if you're a frequent customer and can tell the difference. It is the prefered option for a less crowded Burgerlab, but don't be fooled, it's not always empty. A couple times, it was really crowded, maybe everyone thought alike an ended up here."
0,Ryan Q.,My Burger Lab,"Do not come here if you're hungry, because you'll be embracing your inner cannibalism whilst waiting in the long queue. Thankfully I've already eaten something and it was my cousin who was starving( Sorry though ). It's a unique twist to the original adaption of a burger. This time featuring black buns made out of charcoal. Also, their fries, although fried, are kinda tasty. My cousin was delighted with the sight of his burger. He was in a food coma after finishing that burger, it was that good according to him. Maybe I'd give this a try one day, since you can substitute their meat for a tofu patty. Till then, I'll be anticipating."
0,Su Zanne C.,My Burger Lab,"A local burger join that is famous for it's charcoal bun burgers, crispy fried cheese, and house sauce that plankton would want to try and get his hands on. I ordered the A+ burger and the crispy cheese did it for me. There were so much hype on the fries as well which I thought was alright until I dipped it this special semi-spicy orange coloured sauce. They're not very generous with the sauce despite its high demand, but you can try your luck by asking for more at the pick-up counter.

Expect a long queue, but fret not, the waiters will keep you entertained by explaining what's on the menu down to the details of what goes on in the burger as you wait."
0,Shearlee L.,My Burger Lab,"Been hearing so much bout this, finally gave it a try & I get what's the hype all about now! The rain on a Sunday evening clearly didn't stop lovers from coming because it was full house when we arrived! I quite like the self service concept of the place (yay to no service charge too). The menu though a little confusing, was illustrated on the chalk wall and they have a good variety of  beef, chicken, vegetarian and also sides! I took the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken, and my boyfriend took the Cthuhlu Beef.

Despite it being full, most tables are joint so the staff was nice and got us a place to seat within a minute. You are to hold on to your receipt and wait for your order number that can is displayed, like a bank which I think is so cool! You help yourself to drinks too at the bar where there are several choices.

On first glance, my chicken breast was so thick & huge, immediately warning me on it being tough and dry. But biting into it, it was anything but! Tender, moist and seasoned just right, I love it! The charcoal bun was soft and fresh too, and I love my slippery and tasty mushrooms in it. Only two things I didn't love was the dressing, a little too much and it tasted similar to thousand island just slightly spicier, and also the pineapple that I think is from the can. It would have made a huge difference if my pineapple was fresh and grilled, voila!! Also, I thought that the fries were cut and fried perfectly, not greasy at all, however I like my fries simple, and not overly seasoned with herbs like this ones. My boyfriend's beef burger was simply amazing, they had this black sauce called the Evil Cocktail Sauce and it is served with oysters. I am not too sure what else was in there but I took a bite and thought it was damn good! Probably even better than mine.

The set up of the place was really cool and it had plenty of character. I took a peak and saw about eight pair of gloved hands in the kitchen, no wonder our burgers were quick! It is a little pricey, about RM42 for the both of us, and only one of us had the set, but I'd definitely come back!"
0,Vanessa W.,My Burger Lab,"It was so jam when it comes to friday night especially on raining day and when your class ended late . So my course mates decided to go to this burger lab to have dinner . At first I did not want to go but my friends offer to fetch me so ofcourse I cannot reject them . It was a bit hard to find parking at that place and my friend actually use about 15 minutes to find a parking . But I feel that is worth it because their burger is so nice ! I can't remember what is the name of the burger that I have ordered but the burger is really delicious ! Is my first time visting the restaurant so i decided to ask the waitress for suggestions. She said that it was the best sellers  .The mushrooms in the burger with the black pepper sauce and the combination of chicken slice in the  charcoal bun make the burger is really perfect ! Besides , they also have fries and a soft drinks to complete the meal . The orange colour sauce for the fries is so nice ! A set of burger only cost RM 15 ++. I am sure I will visit them again !"
0,Halstene A.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"This is the closest ribs to back home I can find in KL so far. Tender, fall-off-the-bone slabs with an appropriate tangy BBQ sauce can be found here.  As a cautious/plain-Jane meat eater (I often prefer chicken over red meats), this place actually makes me look forward to and excited about eating pork.

Their sausages are also noteworthy and are served with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I usually order one of the sausages when I'm not up for the heavier slabs of rib option.

It's a chill and unpretentious restaurant, just how BBQ should be. The decor of mixed materials of wood and metal give the appearance of trendy, yet maintains the laid back/casual vibe that makes me enjoy eating there so much.

This is definitely a place to check out in the Sri Hartamas area or at their second location in Bangsar (although to date, I haven't gone to that one yet)."
0,Toby W.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Good food! Had ribs and were delicious , not falling off the bone but very tender, cocktails were good and got a free giant fish bowl cocktail to share at the end, it was undrinkable"
0,Sara M.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"There must be something in the pork ribs here, because they are addictive as hell!  

The first time I came here I made a mistake, I ordered pasta. Who on earth goes to a restaurant that specializes in ribs and orders pasta? That would be me. The pasta pale in comparison to the restaurant's signature dish. I've learned my lesson, I've repented. I now know that if you walk into a restaurant and more than five tables are having the same dish that is what you should order. I sat there waiting for my pasta, looking at all the tables around me all of which ordered the pork ribs. Lucky for me, my friend has ordered that too. I tried a little and was blown away, the ribs were so good. Coated in this sweet and savoury barbeque sauce, served on a rustic wooden board with a small bowl of awesome chili sauce, good god it was an explosion of flavours in my mouth.

The ribs portion is huge enough for two to share and it's reasonably priced too. After my first visit I knew I had to come back again to have the rib and I did. The restaurant get pretty crowded during dinner time, you can always call ahead to make a reservation. But be ready, most of their workers are foreigners and as helpful as they are sometimes it's hard you to understand them (and vice versa) when you call in to make a booking. I've encountered this many times and had to repeat myself over and over again. There's even once I had to call back to check on my reservation because I wasn't sure if my initial booking went through because I could not understand what the person on the line was saying."
0,Jen L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"I know that they are famous for the ribs and steak here but it was 11pm and i do not felt like eating something so meaty so instead i ordered something so creamy - cabonara.

One thing about pub food is that the food sometimes is damn good and sometimes they just cook to earn extra money and i feel like thier cabonara was creamy and good but TOO MUCH CHEESE THAT I FELT LIKE PUKING AFTER. There goes the calories of cheese. My partner ordered burger and it was terrible! My cabonara was RM22 and the burger cost Rm26 - expensive but not worth the delicious food.

The meat is not juicy, dry and the bacon was overcook and the side was just normal fries and sweet potato. Omg! it was bad. Definitely coming back to try the famous ribs and ducks."
0,Josephine N.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,Surprisingly GOOD! We had the Birthday platter which costs RM300 with a free bottle of wine. You can't get any more German than that! The platter consist of everything PORK! You will PORK till you DROP!
0,Marija S.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"WOW !

I am so shocked to see that someone has already been here, because this place opened just last week!

Me and my girlfriend were walking all over bangsar thinking it's time to check out a new place. We kept on making rounds around jalan telawi 1-2-3-4..We almost gave up and ended up where we just started : in front of a new place covered in balloons and friendly staff.

On a saturday evening this place was pleasantly crowded and seemed really social!

So we stayed and tried out some of their dishes!

I enjoyed salmon Caesar salad and my friend Hungarian sausage.

However, I saw some people having pork ribs and I knew for a fact that we've ordered wrong and next time I'm definitely checking out their ribs ;D

Enjoy your meal!"
0,Patience G.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"This is our 5th time to NBDD and the food is consistent. Their signature ribs is superb, juice and tasty! the Jamon platter is value for money. You will not get this anywhere else except in Spain itself! Service is ok but overall is just excellent!"
0,Goh K.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Excellent service and food although busy Saturday night. Tried their Father day menu, full platter of meat with 4 beers. Great stuff !! Genuine Food !!"
0,James L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Came here one afternoon and had a short stay and took only drinks and fries with 2 friends. We arrived at about 4pm and it's very quiet. The crowd didn't seem to arrive until about 630pm or so.

While chilling and having beer inside the outlet. I couldn't help but get turned off by the heavy nicotine smell that is infused into the restaurant. Getting a seat outdoors was definitely a better choice.

After finishing our drinks and fries, we ordered ribs and steak for take away. Food didn't take long to arrive and we get to enjoy everything at the comfort of the house. Price is pretty reasonable for such good food in my opinion."
0,Andy L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Aside from its hard-to-pronounce name, Naughty Babe Dirty Duck is a brand new venture around the area, and while their ribs and steaks are already winning the community.

Ah, but they never met me yet.

The portions served here are admittedly big, but I do not think that the cooks here are any good in differentiating between medium rare and well done. Perhaps that is the single reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 4 star, and with the ambience and the price itself, I can assure you that it will attract more patrons than a puddle of water attracts mosquitos.

That being said, I really like this place, but a mistake is a mistake, and I will love to come to this place... Months later."
0,Bryan S.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"What I particularly like about this place is that the portions don't disappoint. I'll be the first person to admit to the fact that a restaurant's portion size serves as a sizeable determining factor as to whether or not I would patronize a place again and if we're going purely on that, I would come back here again. And again. And again. Naughty Babe Dirty Duck specializes in grilled pork ribs and other meaty creations of the porcine and duck variety. I ordered the grilled pork ribs and a half slab sets you back at around RM38. Tender and well-seasoned, it's decently sized and can easily be shared by a party of two with one or two appetizers on the side. With its catchy name and cozy yet cool vibe, this Hartamas newbie is a great hangout for foodies with an affinity for meat. Its central location makes it accessible but parking can be pain in the derriere"
0,Nicole N.,Lot 10 Hutong,"So many delicious hawker stalls conveniently tucked into one place!! Haven't been back to Malaysia in 5 years, so I was craving lots of street food and luckily Lot 10 Hutong literally had all the dishes I craved during my short trip in KL. The place was clean but a little hard to navigate since it was so big. I would recommend walking around to check out all the stalls/food options before purchasing!
Hokkein Prawn Mee is probably my favorite noodle dish besides the Laksa! Secret Penang Cafe does them perfectly: rich, fragrant broth with a strong shrimp (almost lobster-y) taste with a combo of mee siam and thick egg noodles along with shrimp, ribs, and pork slices. The soup is what gets me because I love the shrimpy, seafood taste and I would 100% recommend this dish!! It has a thin layer of chilli oil but isn't really that spicy. Traditionally, it is also served with sambal chilli on the side but its totally optional. (Compared to the popular Laksa, which has a stronger coconut milk taste, the Prawn Mee is more seafood and pork broth based in my opinion).
I also got the Chendol/Cendol from the only dessert shop in this plaza. It was pretty good too albeit different from the ones I've had in Penang (which is where I believe Cendol originated from). There was the green jelly and bean milk on ice and covered with coconut milk and syrup. Tip: I like get my dessert around the same time I get my main dish because the ice in the dessert can melt as you eat your main meal so you wont taste chunks of ice (that tends to dilute the sweetness) in your first few bites!
They also had bak kut teh, bbq pork and wonton noodles, curry noodles, loh mee noodles, and much more! Despite so many food stalls, I do wish that they had more dessert and drink options. For sure I would recommend this place to others exploring Malaysian food!"
0,Anchisa P.,Lot 10 Hutong,"3.5 stars. Popular food court in Lot 10 Shopping Centre - a food court collecting many of the famous Malaysian hawker stalls

- Food here tastes ok / quite average TBH but a plus for the variety it offers and a pretty nice / clean ambiance overall

- Some better dishes include the char kway teow and hokkien mee"
0,Ben Y.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Lots of selection and you can get a meal for between 5-10 USD.  

We chose two random places and both were good.  
One was the bak kuh teh stall and the other was the Penang one."
0,Jon C.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Great food, fast service but so many options you can barely choose.

The other thing is it's also organized like alley ways so you can get lost or not find what you're looking for.

There are a lot of tables to eat at, but the space to move around is a bit narrow.

However, the food, options and prices make up for it all. You're pretty much paying around 15 ringitts for a dish of noodles here at any place. And it'll be delicious. You just gotta decide which place and don't forget where it is."
0,Angelo B.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Fairly large range of vendors in an air conditioned food court with lots of seating.

We tried a couple of dishes. Everything was fairly decent (although the food was better at the other places I've been). Reviews mention that it's pricey but i didn't think it was too much worse (eg the dish we got at restaurant kin kin earlier in the day was 8, but 11 here).

I wouldn't really recommend coming here unless you're in the area. Plenty of great food elsewhere in KL. but if you must have air conditioning, this is a decent choice."
0,Tyler L.,Lot 10 Hutong,"This is a food court located in the basement of the Lot 10 shopping mall (right next to the Bukit Bintang Monorail stop). It is cheaper than the other food courts but this one has way less variety. There are no Western foods offered here at all. Almost all the stalls were different kinds of Chinese food - Shanghainese, Cantonese, congee, pastries, fried chicken, bubble tea, etc. We ended up choosing a ""Thai"" stall, but the food was not authentic at all. Besides the flavors being off, they were very stingy on the meat. And besides that, the meat was old. The beef in my curry was super hard and very difficult to chew."
0,Pei M.,Lot 10 Hutong,"I loved the pork belly soup! it's a must try~ the jap supermarket is adjacent to it, try the red bean maji!"
0,Clarence J.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Below the Lot 10 Shopping Center is a wonderfully unique hawker center that brings a street food street indoors.  A wealth of Asian street food is served from numerous stalls, which you wander among on narrow paths between stalls and tables.  Pleasantly steamy, bustling with people from various cultures, noisy with cooking sounds and conversations in multiple languages, and with (mostly...) wonderful smells all around you, the Underground is an excellent experience.  Except for times when I have tried something that just did not suit my preferred tastes, I have thoroughly enjoyed the dishes I have had here.  For what it is worth, my favorite so far is the Ipoh curry from a stall part-way up the stairs on the south end of the area.  (It is across from Hei Heng, but I unfortunately cannot t tell what the name is exactly.)  One note: You will likely need to buy food and drinks separately -- most stalls only serve food, while a few focus on drinks.

You can reach the Underground via the street-level escalator off of Jalan Bukit Bintang -- just look for the cluster of Chinese-language signs hanging above and nearby an escalator dropping below -- via stairs near the Lot 10 entrance on Jalan Sultan Ismail, or via escalator from inside Isetan.  I have only been here for dinner so I cannot speak about how crowded it may be at lunch, but you can usually find tables at dinner time.  On occasion, for larger groups that want to eat together, it might benefit you to find a table first and then send people off to buy food instead of counting on finding one of the large tables free after everyone buys their meals.

If you are not up for the street food, Isetan's Japanese market is connected, with its collection of Japanese food and drinks (including excellent tasting stands for sake, beer, whiskey, and wine!)."
0,Tim X.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Food was the highlight of my visit to Kuala Lumpur, and in that spirit, my friend and I planned an entire evening around Lot 10 Hutong. A food court tucked away in the bottom of a mall? I'm there. We had three meals there in the span of an hour and a half: eat, wander and research, repeat.

We were referred here by locals who cited its extreme popularity, but luckily it did not feel crowded and the lines were never too long at each individual place. There is a huge variety of vendors, including barbecue, noodle, Malaysian, Chinese-Malaysian, Japanese, dessert, drinks, and more.

Everything is very reasonably priced and delicious. Highly recommend!"
0,Ronnie S.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Always a great meal to be had here! I like the Hokkien Mee, but the opportunity for a great experience here is unlike many others. I always finish up at Huckleberry in the Japan Store. Quality beyond expectations!"
0,Earng B.,Lot 10 Hutong,Must try Hokkien Mee. It's scrumptious. I like it. Every time I come to Pavillion will walk  cross the road here at Lot10 to eat this Hokkien Mee
0,Brian S.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Lot 10 Hutong is a food court located in the basement of a department store in a mall in central Kuala Lumpur. It features about a dozen different restaurants representing many famous Malaysian dishes. While this food court doesn't have the absolute best food in the country or even city, it is certainly a diverse collection of really good restaurants all under one roof.

We tried dishes from about four of the stands, and we enjoyed all of them. The prices are reasonable (not as cheap as street food, but cheaper than many restaurants), and the seating area is pleasant. There are clean bathrooms and good air conditioning. The metro is only about a 5 minute walk away.  

Bottom line: if you are only in KL for a short time and want to try many different Malaysian dishes, this is a great place to do it."
0,Jasmine Y.,Lot 10 Hutong,"A food court that's owned by one person who decided to pull all the good vendors into one place? It sounds enticing but I was a bit skeptical. The place is located inside an older mall so there weren't many customers in the actual mall.
The food court however was filled with people and there were plenty of stalls to choose from. A lot of them were Chinese though so nothing too local in my opinion. I had wanted to get duck rice from the outside vendors and they had it in the food court so I just decided to get it there. It was good but nothing special. I didn't enjoy the fact that I could get duck neck with my meal though. The portion was also a good size.
My cousin also got us a wok stir fried dark sauce noodle that tasted really good. They come around with a drink and dessert cart. The drinks aren't cold so you need to ask for ice."
0,Suria N.,Lot 10 Hutong,"We dined here and had a rice dish with honey pork barbecue, roast duck, and roast pork, to share. Also a bowl of ABC (sic!) soup, and a bowl of Mee Pok or pork noodles and a bowl of fish balls. Basically it's a food court with the night market atmosphere. Very interesting. Well, the foods just okay but I love the atmosphere where we could watch people walking indecisively."
0,Jon L.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Hutong is located on the lower ground floor of Lot 10. When you enter via the street entrance, it doesn't seem obvious that this is a food court. Usually food courts are pretty straightforward with rows of food stalls. Here the food stalls are structured like a maze. And since it is on the lower ground level, this spot feels very cavernous.

Hutong is a different type of food court than the ones you see at other shopping malls in KL. That is because it consists of over 30 vendors which are all heritage brands. What this means that each eatery has a history dating back at least 40 years and has instant name recognition. Since these vendors have a long history in business, you know that the food here has to be pretty good and has been vetted for quality to be part of this ""best of"" food court.

All of the food vendors are Asian brands. The food offered here seemed to be primarily Chinese and Malaysian. Though there is Korean and Thai food available. Not all of the food stalls are eateries though. There are a few desserts, juice bars and snack places here.

The pricing seems to be a little bit higher than you might pay at other places. But I think it is worth the price because this is an indoor food court with air conditioning and plenty of seating.  And because the heritage brands here are among the best in what they have to offer."
0,M M.,Lot 10 Hutong,It is a food court at the basement of the mall.  The variety and prices are pretty good.  Food was so so.  It is your normal food court food.
0,Karine K.,Lot 10 Hutong,"One of the best food places we have found.
Definitely better and cleaner than Jalan Alor street food.

0,Maria M.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Our favorite brunch at KL, it's under ground level, full of meals to choice from, we always have brunch here everytime we come to visit KL"
0,Jasmine C.,Lot 10 Hutong,"3.5 stars based on this experience. I have heard a lot about this particular food court as it's said to be where all the tried and tested hawker stalls are invited to come under one roof by YTL. Quite a noble intention as it also makes life easier for tourists who want to try the ""best"" but can't quite locate the stalls at their various locations. And it's also because I have guests staying around here that we ended up here.

As it's really a food court, prices are of course more expensive than the actual stalls, but when you think of it, we humans don't mind paying for convenience and the air-conditioning. It's a bit of a maze getting around inside, but I think that embodies the term hutong perfectly. Narrow streets and alleys etc. We only had time to try a couple of items, so I went for the Penang Char Kway Teow and Macau Pork Bun (I think this is the last remaining shop of the franchise as I don't spot them around town anymore).

The wait for the CKT is not too long as there are two young guys frying away. The CKT is quite decent, full of wok hei (smoky) but couldn't really tell the difference between the duck egg and normal chicken egg so I would say, save your RM2 and just have the normal one haha. The stall offers other Penang dishes like assam laksa, curry noodles, lor bak etc but we didn't try it.

The Macau Pork Chop Bun took a while to prepare as it's cooked upon order. But tastewise, it was average. I only used to frequent this chain for the milk tea and I am glad to say the hot milk tea is as good as I remembered.

Anyway, have to try more dishes here to give a fairer rating."
0,Intan N.,Marble 8,"I have been very fortunate to spend my birthday at one of KL's top fine-Marble 8 and it was an experience I will never forget!

This place is a fancy schmancy place with a strict dress code so I was ready to play that strong dress game! Dressing well is a good form of good manners am I right?! Anyway, the place was a bungalow turned restaurant in a strategic location in KL where you can see the Perronas twin towers and it is the perfect backdrop as you enjoy your meal. The interior is ver luxe and elegant, romantic dim lighting and has an upstairs lunge area to further enjoy your wine and cigars.

Moving on to the wondrous food, the real belle of the ball for me was the tomahawk steak! Marble 8 is well known for their steaks but the tomahawk steak is the cut above the rest, it is a huge bone-in rib cut steak with the bone intact that can be shared amongst 4-5 people, soft and tender, I can go on forever. Though pricey (rm2100) for 1.8 kilos to be exact but totally worth it."
0,Ben Y.,Marble 8,"It's one of those places where you go for the view and thankfully the foods not bad either.  

One word of advice though, you can't actually get an unobstructed view of BOTH towers.  The restaurant building is actually too close to the towers and the angle it's at only lets you see one tower and like half of the second one.  

4 stars for the whole package - food, ambience, service, view.  

3 stars for the food alone.  

We got the Bistecca steak for 2 and it was fine.  Supposedly top grade Australian Wagyu which to me is just good USDA Prime.   Places throw out the terms Wagyu and Kobe around a lot but in reality there's real Japanese A5 Wagyu and then there's everything else in a distant 2nd.  

The truffle fries were fine and the portebellos were fine.   In terms of food everything was ""fine.""  Average for a place of this cost.  

The steak, 2 sides, and a bottle of wine cost use around 350 USD which is relatively reasonable I guess.  

It's one of those places where you go for the view and thankfully the foods not bad either"
0,Clarence J.,Marble 8,"I was here for brunch and thought this was good but not what I'd hoped.  The brunch spread was a good-size, although I perhaps greedily expected more for the price.  There was a table of salads/vegetables/fruits, carved meat (roast beef), and breads; a table with three entrees in chafing dishes; and a dessert table.  In addition, the staff brings around small-bite items and bowls of pasta.  The food was good, but I didn't come across anything that wowed me and made me go back for more.  (Not that that stopped me from going back for more, especially because I'm a sucker for pasta.)  You can choose all-you-can-drink options with prosecco, wine...and maybe beer?

The brunch is served in a beautiful setting, with elegant, dark shades indoors that highlight the excellent view of KLCC Park and the Petronas Towers through the floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides of the restaurant.  The staff is friendly and efficient."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Marble 8,"Coming here for a F1 pre-party, marble 8 was a statement of class and luxury.

Slightly different from other restaurants or bars that might call themselves the luxury outlets, this place actually have their staff properly trained as well that you will not be having unpleasant experience while you're there.

I was in the guest list for the party while there's a cover charge for those walking in, which is a charge of rm99++

The place actually has steakhouse, bar and PRIVE. The bar is very comfortable and you don't feel too cramped up, and there's a small dance floor area in front of the dj stage.

Outside there's this patio area with seats as well. With good view of the bright klcc at night, it's a very nice place to chill and catch up with friends.

For their bar they do serve a very wide range of beverages from beer to wine, cocktails to mocktails and more.

For such a nice ambience i would say that the price list is rather fair. Also, they have happy hours from 6-9 which the happy hours rates are actually very good.

Parking is free in the building's compound here and usually it's not a problem to get a spot here unless you're coming a little late.

Overall, nice environment, very suitable for events as well, great service, fair price - definitely coming back again."
0,Kim A.,Marble 8,"We enjoyed a very nice view and a great dinner and even better service. After a mishap with the hostess at the beginning of the evening, we were very glad we stayed for the dinner. Management handled the mishap very professionally. The steak and sides were the best we have had on our two week holiday."
0,Patience G.,Marble 8,"The very best steaks in the city! My favourite of all time is the dry-aged bone in tenderloin, followed by rib-eye and tomahawk. Oh yes not forgetting the sundries tomato pasta and grilled soy sauce cod fish! I love job as I get to taste it first hand!"
0,Julie Y.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has been making waves in the KL fine dining scene as its well known for their steaks. You know this place means business when they require you to pay a deposit if you make a reservation and there is also a minimum order as well. So bring your wad of cash and be prepared to spend quite a bit here.

The restaurant is located in its own compound so there is limited complimentary parking available for diners. The stunning view of the twin towers is part of the highlight at Marble 8. Besides the restaurant, there's also a bar and prive set up for guests who want to lounge around.

A window showcasing the room where the meats are dried is also another fascinating feature you'll find at Marble 8. Though the place is known for their steaks i opted for their lobster instead as I was cutting back on meat. My dish did not disappoint but I was sorely tempted by the steak which warrants a second visit."
0,Nicole S.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 is a fancy smansy bar located in the heart of KL. It has an amazing view but doesn't beat Marini's mainly because its not on the 57th floor but on the ground floor so you have to look up for your view of the city skyline. The drinks here are so-so. I had the screwdriver and didn't like it one bit. However friends who had the pina colada said it was very good.

The atmosphere outside is very pretty because there are a lot of plants and hedges. However, if it happens to start raining, you have no shelter and so have to move back inside. This place has a really cool DJ console,Its elevated pretty high and gives the DJ a good view of the crowd and vice versa. The cocktails go for about RM30 which is pretty pricey for the quality that you get. The only reason i would come back here is because of the gorgeous view."
0,Khalisah K.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has a trio venue with different offerings which consists of elegance. Their premium steakhouse, modern chic bar, and elegant privé. I've only managed to make my way to the M8 bar recently and i was very impressed. It was ultra-stylish and simple at the same time and that made it spectacular. M8 has been conceptualized as Kuala Lumpur's bar destination for its sophistication and elegance.

My favorite part of M8, is of course the al-fresco area, the view of the Twin Towers is so stunning. M8 bar's prices are very reasonable for what it is. I mean come on, you're hanging out with your friends, drinking, good music and a breathtaking view. What more could you ask for?!"
0,Arild H.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has closed the restaurant in Lorong Kuda/Binjai and moved to Petronas tower 3 level 56, opening 2 week of April 17"
0,Dennis D.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"Malaysia Boleh! I love Kuala Lumpur! This is one of my favorite kopi tiam's in the town. I've been here many times, since I was a child. This place has gone through generation after generation- even my PohPoh came here a lot way back in the day (it's been around since 1956). The general area is kind of touristy because it's located near Central Market and Petaling Street (get you a nice fake LV and Rolex, if you want), but this particular place is mainly Malaysians.

Beef noodles are the #1 thing here. You can get tendon, meatball, organs, brisket, anything of your choosing. Seating is challenging. It's really popular among locals, so you might have to stand around and wait. BUT I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Would you want to fly all the way to this beautiful country and only be able to tell your friends you ate 'tourist food?' Check this place out.

One thing to keep in mind, when visiting KL in this part, the area is notorious for motorcycle theft. Meaning, some dude might try to run up and snatch your purse or chain and take off on his buddy's getaway bike. It's not by any means a terribly dangerous area, but just be a little extra careful, because low-life scum try to prey on unsuspecting tourists in all countries. Now with that being said, is it worth risking a precious belonging over some beef noodles? The answer is a resounding YES. Eat, lah!"
0,David S.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"It seems as if when you cross the border into Malaysia the nature of the restaurants change dramatically, at least with regards to the hawker variety. This is basically one such place where you have four stalls inside the room, each of them selling their own product. So, you might get your meal from one stall, and a beer from another. Mind you, this place was pretty cool, especially since the entire place erupted in cheers when I purchased as tiger beer. I guess they were impressed that some Anglo was willing to drink the local fair as opposed to the ubiquitous Heiniken. Then again, I do try to avoid Heiniken."
0,T. H. S.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"First thing first: you can get almost anything here at Lai Foong! Noodles of all kinds, dry or soup, fried rice, chicken rice, char siew, siew yok, wantan mee, porridge, beef noodle, pork noodle, dim sum, hakka luei cha (veggie mix), freshly-baked tarts, cookies and buns, siewpao, kaya kok, even western breakfast! Every old-time delicates, you'll find them here. The hard part? Choosing what to eat. It's an old-time chinese restaurant with a very rich cultural surrounding, in the middle of the busy KL city centre. Everytime I come here, it's so crowded to the sense that people are pushing each other around. Sometimes waiters are having a hard time to walk pass the crowd. The food is definitely a cause of it. It's super hot inside though. Then again, that's the essence, experiencing the heat and liveliness of the oldtown. Also, it's very close to Petaling Street. One minute walking distance. *recommended*"
0,Weinye C.,Restaurant Siu Siu,"Honestly, I personally know the owners of this place and I'm not writing a review because of that. I'm writing this because I feel this place doesn't get enough attention as they should!

I've frequent this branch and the original one (near Mid Valley) many times before. The menu would most likely have all the common items that you would find in a Chinese restaurant but they have some specialties that are worth mentioning. Just ask for a recommendation and they will give you some of the popular and favourite items on the menu.

Eventhough everything is good, their specialties are the river fishes and char siew (only limited quantities each day). I've introduced this place to my friends who live in Damansara that would drive to KL just to have char siew here and to tapau some home for later. I would say, best is to call ahead just to check if the char siew is still available if you're planning to try it out.

This place is huge with indoor (there's a small section with AC and the rest is with fan) and outdoor gazebo seating. So it's a good place to host big gatherings, office or family dinners. There's also a huge stage (with mics and speakers etc) in the restaurant so if you're thinking of hosting a big birthday party or anniversary dinner, you may use the stage for your get together as well. It also has a huge (free) parking lot upfront with a parking attendant.

So, if you're around KL and would like to have some seafood or Chinese food and not want to deal with looking for a parking spot and is away from all the busy streets, crowds and tight spaces, I'd recommend for you to try this place out :)"
0,Lori A.,The Canteen Room,"Im a very picky eater,but they have some awesome food. They have many many things to choose from. The juices and coffee is the bomb . They have very fast service and very ...very nice. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Malaysia. It's very convenient to many other places.
I will definitely come back, when I am in Malaysia."
0,Yenny L.,Restoran Hung Kee,"Best charred char siew that I have had. Will definitely be back when I visit KL! We ordered more char siew after we ordered a plate of char siew and siew yok!
Every single piece tastes so good, salty and sweet. The charred part is da bomb!

The plate of kailan is also good. The stalk is soft and well cooked.

Noodle is just so so but you cannot miss the char siew for sure!"
0,Jane T.,Restoran Hung Kee,"1st try at this Restaurent. I got to know from a friend that it's famous for wan tan mee. Since I'm going to town might as well drop by to give it a try.

It's located at Jalan loke yew where some old looking bridal house were located. Parking here is quite troublesome as its along the road side or you have to drive behind the shop lots where the housing area is to park.

The shop has aircon and the typical coffee shop hot and stuffy area. Of course I choose to sit in the cooling area;)

I ordered dry wan tan mee with char Siew . For me the wan tan mee is just okay, nothing to shout about. It's too salty, char Siew is just okay too as I had better char siews. The wan tan is the soup type, it's quite big in size and quite flavorful.

I ordered a side of Sai you fish ball soup. The small size come with 5 fish balls and some Veges. The soup is bland and the fish ball is also normal too. They too have other noodle dishes such as friend Cantonese mee, friend hokkien mee and so on.

Overall experience is just normal."
0,Wye Mun K.,Restoran Hung Kee,"One of the oldest restaurants around in KL. It's been around since the 1990's. Hung Kee is known for its awesome Char Siew and Wanton Mee. Apart from that, they serve dishes as well. One of the famous dishes they serve is their Steamed Ginger Fish.

The restaurant may look old and shabby but ignore its appearance as the food is definitely awesome!!

I've been eating there since I was young and even up till today the food is still good!! For those of you who are around KL, its a must go to place for awesome Char Siew and Wanton Mee.

They are open for lunch and dinner, i'm not so sure about breakfast."
0,Jocelyn W.,Restoran Hung Kee,"Won tun mee never goes wrong, the ""BBQ"" pork is amazing, if it's not recommended by friend, I won't pass by there."
0,Simina I.,Tarbush Restaurant,"I've been here once for a lunch with my team from work. We decided to try Moroccan food for the first time.

Once we arrived here, the staff guide us to the table and brought us the menu. It took us a while to decide what to order because we never had before this type of dish. But with the help of the friendly stuff we manage to order some delicious food. I have to say that I'm impressed with the Moroccan food: meat...salads...drinks...everything was perfect.

The interior design of the place is very nice, in Moroccan style...the staff has traditional Moroccan outfits. The place is perfect for meetings because is not noise and you can also go here for a date because the red colour of the walls, gives a romantic touch.

In regards to the price, I can't say anything because the company payed for us, so I haven't seen the bill.

P.S. In case that you want to go here with a big group, I recommend you to make a reservation."
0,Ronnie S.,Tarbush Restaurant,Great example of Middle Eastern fare. This place really has some great food service habits. Great food served by a large talented staff. I recommend this place over a few other good restaurants just because of their discipline in service.
0,Ahmed D.,Tarbush Restaurant,"This restaurant is one of the best in Malaysia.. its a Lebanese which serve Arabic cuisines in its original form & taste.. We had a great time & the view from the balcony to the busy street nearby is awesome.
Absolutely recommending it to anyone who likes arabic foods or want to try it in Malaysia especially in Bukit Bintang. The prices compared to the delicious foods is really acceptable."
0,Alexandra M.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Looking for a Middle Eastern Restaurant in Malaysia? Here you have it.

They use fresh and really great quality ingredients which makes the food very delicious. The interior decor is really authentic and really makes you want to take a quick trip to Morocco. The dishes are really delicious and their menu has a large variety to pick from.

If you stop by you have to try one of their Shish Kebabs. They are amazing. The service is good and the ambiance is very welcoming and inviting."
0,Brighthoney W.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Great Arabic salads, good meat dishes. I don't know why people raved about the Baclava, it tasted like something that sat in the fridge for too long.
Great for tourists and people curious about Middle eastern cuisine."
0,Lucie B.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Tarbush is a fantastic middle eastern restaurant providing delicious, authentic food full of flavor!
The arabic salad, lamb flat bread and shish tawouk are stand outs. Could eat at this delicious place every day!"
0,Nicole S.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Tarbush serves middle eastern food such as briyani, shish kebab, shawarma etc. Its definitely 100% without a doubt my favorite middle eastern restaurant simply because the food is delicious. The ambiance is nothing to shout about, i mean there are some camels on the wall and the whole place sorta looks like a desert. They make really good garlic dip to pairs perfectly with the lamb cubes or shish tawook.  

Prices are a little expensive but the food is consistent and you can be sure to be only served the best. I would recommend the chicken and lamb briyani, the lamb cubes and the mixed grill which consist of lamb chops, shish kebab and shish tawook. Once you eat at Tarbush, trust me you'd never wanna have middle eastern food anywhere else."
0,Sara M.,Tarbush Restaurant,"This place is absolutely epic! You have amazingly tasty middle easter food! the place is located on the top flour of BSC. I went there for a team lunch and we ordered like a family menu and we had all these different options laid out for us! it was beautiful and tasty!

I loved the baklava and the Moroccan tea! they also had some moroccan dishes which can blow your mind! Don't hesitate to give this place a try! it's over priced but it's so worth it!!"
0,Shoaib D.,Tarbush Restaurant,Great food. It's the place for the kebab eaters to visit. Highly recommended. I also tried the Halabiya (the pudding with milk cream?) and tasted awesome. This is a bit expensive by KL standards.
0,Robert S.,Shawarma Damascus,"This place seems to be quite a popular shawarma place in Bukit Bintang. This particular location is new and not too far from the old place. Somewhat is more accessible I think.

The shop always have customers, so the grill is always on and the meats kept being shaved (which equates to juicy meats). We had a chicken shawarma, and thought the chicken was well seasoned and flavored. The veggies are okay.

Prices are reasonably low. Many items are less than MYR10. You may dine in, take out, or in our case, just eat your sandwich at the curb. The meats portion is not as generous as the one that I usually get in the States, but then again the price is only at a fraction that we usually pay at the States.

I would definitely come back when in the area. I would definitely also pay more for the extra meats."
0,T F.,Shawarma Damascus,The best Shawarma in town. I did try both Chicken and Beef shawarma Great food and price is cheap for Reg roll only 6.00 RM.
0,pete e.,Shawarma Damascus,The Shawarma is the best I had out of Damascus. I enjoyed the beef flavor the most. It was easy to find. Quick service and felt like it was the thing I was looking for
0,Jorensylv N.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Love this Arabic restaurant to bits...! Their food standard is high in terms of taste and variation. Nothing compares to the bread they make here, and I mean it! It really depends on the chef's mood, if not in the mood, the chef makes it still nice, but not as good. There are many times when the bread tastes magical! You may request for the chef to cook the bread a little longer to make it crispier.

The dishes to die for here are the chicken and mutton Ogda (served in hot black stone bowl)!! Their taste might be something U've never tried before. The meat was shredded very finely , it almost looks like beaten eggs. I believe the meat in these 2 dishes have been set in oven overnight at a relatively low temperature, allowing the heat to soften the meat. This method might also the reason as to why their mutton doesn't have that 'stinky' mutton smell. This is the first time in my life taking so much mutton, I usually hate the smell of mutton, but this, love it.

As for their kebab, I wouldnt say it ranks in the top for their restaurant. Chicken kebab wasn't really cooked thoroughly with some parts in pink, beef kebab proved a little too tough as well, but taste is quite nice. There's not much taste to the fish kebab either except for the salt haha. Love their homemade garlic mayonnaise, great to go with fries!

If u're looking at juices, I recommend the grape juice as it's freshly pressed, all natural! All goodness in a cup, mango juice wise, they mix it with puree and mango meat. Not too bad.

Service wise, the waiters were really helpful and friendly. Overall, this my if my favourite Arabic restaurant here in Kuala Lumpor, and it's known to serve great food! Sometimes rumours can't go too wrong ;)"
0,Clarence J.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Wadi Hawdramawt is a good-sized place sitting behind a car lot on Jalan Ampang.  The airy downstairs and upstairs dining rooms have plenty of seating at tables of all sizes, and there are at least a few tables in a covered outdoors area as well.

The food from the large menu and is very good all around, cooked beautifully and with wonderful spices.  The standout to me is always the rice, which is one of the top one or two rices I have had around Kuala Lumpur (with the other being Chen-Chen Goose & Duck in Pudu).  Other than the rice though, I have been able to try many things on the wonderful menu and have not felt that I have made a bad choice yet."
0,Tina M.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Best Arabic in KL, went back two more times on our trip. Had the lamb and chicken and it was delicious. Had lentil soup and it was great. Hummus with lamb was amazing. I miss the food here!"
0,William D.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"This is my pick for the best Arabic food in KL.  It took me a few years to finally go in to have a meal because it is in a very unassuming spot for such great food.  Who would have thought to look for a fine dining experience sandwiched in between to car dealerships on a pretty ugly stretch of Jalan Ampang?  Make no mistake, this place is great.  

The bread here is epic.  It is fresh, flavorful, pulls apart beautifully for dipping and wrapping, but most of all it is huge :) This bread alone is worth the trip.  I love that they have one specific baker for the bread and if he is not in there is no bread.  Complete quality control.

My second favorite this here is called Ogda chicken.  It also come in a lamb version.  It is slowly cooked chicken that melts in your mouth and has just the right amount of spice.  Wrap a piece of their bread around a bite of this and you will see why I am raving about it so much.  

I also like the Moroccan soup and the mint tea they serve.  The service is good too.  I have always found the staff super friendly and accommodating."
0,Joanna H.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"My family loves this restaurant.  The food is good and the staff is friendly.  We love the humus with huge Arabic bread, the Mandy, the mixed barbecue...much more.  Go there, you'll love it, too!"
0,Sandy L.,Lai Po Heen,"I came here with my family for their Chinese New Year dinner menu.
The feast started off with Yee Sang but we requested for fruits instead of raw salmon, and they gave us fresh pear slices which were good too.

They cooked each dish very delicately and all with fresh ingredients, cooked till just right. I liked the stir fried prawns with coconut sauce and steamed fish. The waiters were really helpful that they attended all our requests politely and assisted us in serving the dishes in individual plates.

We could watch the chefs cooking through the glass partition and they nodded and smiled at us as if we're welcomed by them too.

I would love to try their dim sum menu some day!"
0,Vanessa O.,Lai Po Heen,"Definitely one of the most expensive Chinese Meal I've ever had in my life. Fortunately, I was here for a corporate meal which didn't cost me a single penny! I'm not used to this pampering lifestyle but was luckily to be part of this lunch. Food here is simply fantastic. Once you dine here, you will understand what does fine dining (Chinese) truly means.

The service was excellent and the waiters / waitresses were extreme attentive to your needs. Tea was constantly filled up whenever it reaches to the middle of your tiny tea cups. Food quality was nice but the portion was slightly small... nonetheless enough for us to have our tummies filled for a lunch.

Each serving was served in a timely manner where there is not much waiting in between - simply fantastic."
0,Shaun K.,Lai Po Heen,"Duck is good.
They carved it in front of you.

Food and service is 5 star standard.

Strict timing on opening times.

Selective seating.

Bias towards white sometimes.

Tea is expensive"
0,Wye Mun K.,Lai Po Heen,"Looking for a hotel with a great Chinese Restaurant? Head over to Lai Po Heen in Mandarin Oriental! They won multiple awards for their food and they have renown chefs cooking your food so don't worry, you'll definitely be satisfied even for the price you pay.

I've been here a couple of times and I never was disappointed. Great service, great food and of course the price is kinda ""great"" as well. I'm not sure if they still serve their Honeydew Chicken but if they still do, you gotta try it. Food is fresh and flavourful of course, definitely a great place to go to if you're willing to pay the price!"
0,Jean-Luc D.,Lai Po Heen,Excellent food! I am usually not fond of chinese food but I found the food served in this restaurant more than excellent. We were a party of 15 and were served in a private room.
0,Sue W.,Lai Po Heen,"Was here for our CNY reunion dinner on Sunday and as always, Lai Poh Heen delivered! Food and service was good - which is why we return year after year. We had a customised set menu which started with yee sang and ended with jelly for dessert. Service staff is so very trained - more than a dozen were foreigners and they took the effort to recite the ""blessings"" before and while serving the yee sang. Shows how much effort Mandarin puts into staff training. Only let down was the ""missing"" steamed garoupa - it was mistakenly sent to another table by which time, we didn't have much of a mood to eat. They did offer us a dim sum lunch replacement or a rebate on the bill. So that was thoughtful of them - actually they even gave us the fish to take home since it was already made (a new fish) before the message was passed to the kitchen."
0,Aris L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"One of my favorite restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. I ordered siew yok (roast pork), barbecue pork, and the roast chicken with hainanese chicken rice. It tastes really good. I will definitely comeback to this restaurant again..

CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!! MUST TRY!!"
0,Mindy D.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"The roast pork here is like crack! So crispy that you can hear the crackling with every bite. Skip the chicken cause it's all about the siew yuk here. The meats are served with fragrant rice cooked in chicken broth and other flavorings. So simple yet so delicious!

Don't expect the best service here... Actually, the service was terrible. They are super busy and could care less if you get served. You have to fend for yourself. The tables are open seating, but you gotta order at the counter first. Learn from me and don't sit there for 15 minutes and wait for a server to approach you. There's no systematic way of ordering because you literally just yell your order to the lady who's also running around the restaurant. The menu is all in Chinese... good luck, friends. Cash only."

0,Hiroki K.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"Very nice taste, in particular, sauce is the secret of the magic. Enjoy chicken rice with pork!"
0,Carolyn L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"The sio bak (or siew yoke or roast pork belly) is to die for here! Thin crispy crackling skin with juicy tender meat.

I am not a big fan of pork and when friends hear me wax lyrical on the sio bak here, they know it is a ""die die must try place"".

I have been here twice in 2 years and the quality remains consistent for me.

The roast chicken is nice but nothing outstanding. The char siew is slightly better as it has a honeyed taste or maybe it is molasses sweetened. Maybe if you could request for the fatty char siew (we didn't ask so not sure if they would accommodate the request), then it would be better. Our plate of char siew is a mix of lean and fatty meat. My friends definitely prefer the fatty bits.

I had heard about the long queues from my Malaysian friends who introduced me to this place and was told to get there before 12pm. On Friday (and possibly most weekdays), it was already crowded and hard pressed to find an empty table. There would also be a line forming. The line is for ""takeaways"", so just go straight to a table if you are dining in. Saturday was much better though the tables were mostly filled up by 1230pm.

The staff will go around taking your order. Then you wait and wait and wait till 1230pm when the master chef will appear and start chopping the luscious roast meat.

The price is on the high side for sio bak (RM16 per strip) but it is because they give you the best part of the meat. The odds and ends are not served to customers so all get the center parts of the sio bak. This place is quite old school and you can help yourself to the soup from the gigantic pot at the side of the coffee shop.

The rice served is chicken rice so it gives an additional fragrance and taste to the meat.

I am just thankful I don't live in KL otherwise I can see myself coming here very often.

Note:
1, It is closed on Sunday.

2. Do yourself a favor and order a strip of sio bak for each person so that there is no fighting. The portion for 1 is not very big anyway.

3. Get the MyTeksi App if you do not drive as it can be hard to flag down a cab there. Also prepare your GPS map as not all taxi drivers know this place, the GPS will help direct the taxi driver and tell the driver it is near Times Square or the old Pudu jail area."
0,Hobart L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"Don't waste your time on their chicken rice and char siew. There are way better options elsewhere. In my mind, there's only one thing worth getting here, and it's their siew yoke. Crispy skin that crackles easily when you bite into it, followed by this spot-on ratio of fat to meat that melts in your mouth. Sure, there are times when it is quite a let down (meat was too chewy for e.g. last week), but Wong Kee at its best produces the perfect siew yoke that's almost heavenly. Until I find a better place, this is where I keep coming back week after week.

Probably more of a 4.5 stars to 4 given recent disappointments, but like I said, at its best, there is no better siew yoke.

Note: Come during weekends as there is less of a crowd. It only starts serving siew yoke at 12.30pm sharp, but people start flowing in around 12pm. No need to come too early on weekends, but make sure you come before 1.30-2pm because that's usually when it sells out."
0,Benjamin T.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"I've been here many times and each time the Siew Yuk makes me speechless. The crispy skin and melt in your mouth pork makes it one of the best if not the best Siew Yuk in KL in my opinion. I actually like their chicken as well, well cooked and marinated. Not as good as the Siew Yuk of course, but is definitely a compliment to a hearty meal."
0,Jason T.,Restaurant Wong Kee,Best in town roasted pork (siu yoke). Despite my family in similar business and countless tasting of roasted pork. I still yet to find a match. Try it yourself. Make sure you are here by 12.30pm for seats and u will need to wait till 1pm for the food. Usually everything will be sold out within an hour of their business starts

0,Yi En N.,Breakfast Thieves,The price is high. The food so so though special and creative. The drink is quite special and great.
0,Trena M.,Breakfast Thieves,"Situated right next to Pulp, Breakfast Thieves is the newest hipster spot in Bangsar. Not only is the food trendy (with descriptions like sesame shards, perfumed strawberry, chocolate soil, etc), but the waiters come with attitude (not the good kind).

The coffee is on point, and Pulp will definitely be facing some fierce competition. For food, we ordered the French toast, yogurt parfait and salmon with polenta. All delicious, but the portions are ridiculously small and the food is a bit high maintenance. The place gives off that vibe as soon as you walk in though, and I expected no less. Overall, I prefer a place with less frills that doesn't leave me hungry."
0,abu h.,Breakfast Thieves,"Excellent place. The atmosphere is really cool. The service was great and the food was superb. We had the legend (must try), terry Benedict (pretty good), and breakfast chain (excellent)"
0,Sandy L.,Inner Mongolian Steamboat,"This restaurant is located among several shoplots with plenty of Chinese cuisine (such as Hunan, Sichuan, etc). We ordered the roast lamb leg (that requires one day reservation ahead), mongolian milk tea that tastes slightly salty and clear, steamboat with double soups (one 清汤 - herbal clear soup and one 麻辣 - spicy).

We enjoy the variety of dumplings both pan fried or soup boiled, which were so fresh and taste was flavourful. A friend even order more frozen dumplings for takeaway to bring home.

The restaurant isn't always full, but it does take them some time to prepare and serve the food."
0,Mickey L.,1919 Restaurant,"An all-around really pleasant meal to wrap up my visit to Kuala Lumpur. The wait staff were friendly, polite, and extremely helpful, telling us (the unacquainted diners in the realm of Nyonya cuisine) where the good food was.

We ordered four small dishes for two people, and every single dish nailed the spot. The fried Philippine eggplant recommended by our server was cut and fried just like French fries (but tasted better because it was eggplant inside)! The ostrich meat, which I've never tried before, was delicious when cooked teppanyaki style. The nyonya fried rice tasted a little spicy and contained different seasonings that I hadn't tasted before, but every bite of it was enjoyable. Lastly, the mixed vegetables with tofu provided superb balance to our meal, and the homemade tofu stood out for its soft texture and delightful flavor.

What a fantastic and unusual meal - strongly recommend to both locals and tourists alike."
0,Kamal K.,1919 Restaurant,"A good feel of Baba Nyonya cuisine although the service could use more help. Came here for lunch with a group for something different away from KLCC where we work.  A bit too close for a taxi ride but a bit too far for a walk. The taxi vote won.
When we stepped in, we saw a charming restaurant with a traditional feel in decoration and furnishing.  
Service was slow and we weren't attended to for about 15 minutes after being handed the menu.  From the looks of it their wait staff was undermanned.
Luckily that was the only downside.  
Food arrived quickly and all the dishes were tasty.  Our original order for a deep fried garoupa siam style was not available after we checked on our remaining order and was replaced with fish head curry.  A good alternative but it would have helped to be informed earlier.
In the end a stomach well filled, with authentic cooking that makes you want to order everything on the menu just to have a taste. When you have a craving for home cooked style food you won't be disappointed here."
0,Johnny T.,1919 Restaurant,"When I first arrived here, the place is a little dodgy but the place looks very well decorated. One of the little treasures you find in KL. I came here for my friend's birthday as he likes chinese food very much. This place is more to nyonya kind of Chinese food. I was quite impressed by this place, the decoration have some antique furniture, mostly wooden tables and some marble tables, has that very old phone ringing. Makes it feel like an old nyonya house feel.
  The food is not bad, their dishes really well cooked in terms of th I like their Sweet & Sour fried fish, their salted egg fried chicken is also good. Just that this kind of place is a little more pricey than your usual chinese restaurants. Sotong is more pricey as usual. You can actually park around the restaurant but quite limited. You must slow down after passing Ambank tower because you can easily missed this place. But overall the food here not bad, pricey but not bad."
0,Alysa B.,Opium,"My boyfriend and I came in one afternoon expecting basic cocktails, what we received was an amazing, personalized drinking experience with Laine. We were the only ones sitting at the bar which may be why we were able to receive the attention we got but it was easily the best service and experience I've had at a bar.

I started with the Red Moon which was sooooo delicious and refreshing with vodka and watermelon; while my boyfriend had a gin martini. After our first round, we asked Laine for recommendations. She recommended something to each of us based on our palette. I had the 50 shades of grey cocktail which was delicious and also so much fun to watch being made!

Laine told us so much about herself and the owner of the restaurant who also owns a few other places on the street (all known to be the best in KL). Our experience was sooo amazing and I can't wait to find myself back in KL to come back!"
0,Cyrus A.,Opium,"This restaurant was absolutely fantastic, it's an excellent choice if you're looking for a fancy meal at a relatively affordable price. My friend and I split a noodle dish and two entrees, as well as a fancy cocktail each, all for around $75 total.

The place is a little noisy, and definitely in a touristy/fratty part of town. But once we were seated, we had outstanding service and really enjoyed the experience. Our server was very helpful, and made great suggestions about the various options on the menu.

We started with crispy noodles and fried prawns, which were delicious. The noodles come in a great broth, and the prawns are lightly battered, crispy to perfection.

For our mains, we split a beef dish that we ate on soft buns. It was spicy without being overpowering, and the flavors were unreal. After the buns ran out, I was eating straight from the bowl! We also got a duck dish with rice. The duck was tender and juicy, with a sweet flavor and lots of delicious veggies included in the dish.

I would definitely recommend this place as a dinner destination during even a short stay in Kuala Lumpur!"
0,Louise A.,Opium,"Celebrated my birthday here and so were two more persons cuz they started sing for them. Yeah whatever, I think this place was really good. The environment was hipster and a little retro. There was a girl sitting and playing some kind of piano very beautifly, and the mood was great!
I ate some dumplings with black pepper and prawns, delicious, and my man took some noodles, they were really good too. The drinks had a twist and they were served in special cups, fun! Over all a great place for a birthday dinner, some drinks with your friends or a dejt. But I think the kids should be left home. Not that kind of place..."
0,Bob V.,Opium,"By the reviews I was anticipating a wow & I got excellent service along with mediocre food. I started with the Fighting Cock Wings w/habenero. Soggy & mild flovor,
right out of the microwave.  Rather disappointing, as i was here for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening 6:30pm. Lets see if the main course is any better? Yes the lemon orange chicken was better but I would not return with much better options out there!
Not worth the price."
0,Neil M.,Opium,"Loved everything about Opium! Service, food, music were all great. Food was very unique and special with decent portions.

Highly recommend for the price. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place is hard to beat for $$."
0,Cindy C.,Opium,very nice restaurant and bar. meals were tasty cocktail was super special. we enjoyed it very much. live music was a girl play Chinese pipa. price is a but expensive.about $150 per person. will go back if get chance.
0,Bartholomew B.,Opium,"My first time to KL and asked the hotel concierge for the best local restaurant - they were spot on. This place is amazing and unique. The food was superb, the drinks were the most artistic and delicious I've received to date. The 4 spirits drinks are so cool - I had Earth and Water on 2 different days. I also had a draft beer, which they serve in a bowl - was odd at first but kind of made me feel like a cat. The staff were sweet and quick. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're unsure where to go."
0,Lucie B.,Opium,"Went here for the all you can eat DIM SUM lunch and it was awesome, 28RM for as many plates of dim sum, noodles and other dishes and all was of great quality and taste.

I also just love the decor here, it truly feels like you have stepped into a time warp. They play great lounge music and the furnishings are gorgeous. Definitely still 5 stars in my book."
0,LeEllen L.,Opium,"Amazing food and wonderful service. :) I really enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere, the music and the lighting, it was a delightful and delicious evening."
0,John W.,Opium,"It's ok. Food is good but not great. Cocktails are the same... not the worst but certainly not cocktail bar standards. People there are friendly though! Good service. I wouldn't return since there are clearly way better options around. But if I was forced to go, I would not be too upset."
0,Björn K.,Opium,"Seriously delicious food, friendly staff helping you out with what goes with what and even how to eat it, Watch out for the deep fried chillies, they're mortal!
Had some dumplings (super yummy), some quinoa (even more yummy) and a desert with sago (sweeeeet)!!!"
0,Jim D.,Opium,Been twice now.  The lunch set is tasty and good value for money.  The regular menu is...  Expensive for what you get.
0,Catherine S.,Opium,My friend and I had a great meal here. Most authentic Asian meal I've tasted but I'm no expert. We had  main noodle dishes and dim sum. Very flavorable. The service was top notch.
0,Wen H.,Opium,"Something that caught my eyes in Changkat due to the vintage Chinese ambience at the corner of Changkat road, we went in to have our dinner. Opium is a bar cum restaurant with a Chinese theme. The decoration is worth a visit to this restaurant. It is also very famous for its cocktails. We ordered Ti-Lung Bramble and Red Lantern Margarita. All their cocktails are served in wooden tray accompanied with 2 different type of nuts.

For main course, we ordered the Crispy Duck Noodles with crispy yee mee noodles served over a rich brown sauce and topped with a smoked duck slices. Another main dish that we ordered is the eye catching Opium Black Fried rice. It is very delicious and very flavorful. The black fried rice comes from squid ink.

Overall the food is delicious however the pricing is a tad bit more on the expensive side. Worth the try."
0,Jonathan S.,Opium,"Ordered the beef rendang, thought it was overpriced until I realized just how much meat they'd given me. And the service was impeccable. Highly recommend"
0,Lars S.,Opium,The salmon Noodle was awesome. The 5 seasoning duck as well. The beef dishes however did not meet our expectations. But beef is always a gamble in aisia if you ask me. Very friendly staff by the name of Marvin.
0,Shandos C.,Opium,"Gorgeous little cocktail bar and restaurant with lots of atmosphere. Most of the bars along this busy strip had screens showing the football, which we decided to skip, in favour of this bar on the corner, which initially had a live musician playing traditional music. The cocktails are fantastic, especially the presentation. However, they were the most expensive drinks we had when visiting Malaysia - about 40 ringgit once tax & service was added ($13 AUD, not much less than I'd pay in Sydney bars)."
0,Ross H.,Opium,Our favorite meal in KL.  Very creative cocktails and solid food.  I highly recommend the wings.  Great atmosphere and service.
0,Peter L.,Opium,"Opium KL has been open only since last year, but it already feels like a fixture in Bukit Bintang and for good reason.  Start with a beautiful  space at a prime corner location, good food and cocktails and a cheerful staff, it's a great place to relax and enjoy.  The retro Chinese décor is inviting, and there is a patio in addition to some very nice booths and regular tables.  On the past three trips, they also had live music on a traditional Chinese string instrument which also added to the atmosphere.  I really love the cocktails here even though I normally stick to traditional cocktails.  The creativity and presentation is awesome, and I normally start off with an Eastern Aviation, a twist on the Aviation but using cherry liquor instead of crème de violette.  I also love the Shanghailander, a nice balance between peated whiskey and lemon juice.  And the presentation of 50 Shades of Grey is quite creative.  As for the food, it's a mix of local and Chinese food.  The black pepper dumpling was a bit soggy.  Better was the Sugarcane prawns, which were fried nicely.  The black fried rice was also quite good, and I've enjoyed the beef rending, served with buns on 3 occasions.  I've been to KL now 3 times during the past year, and each time, I've ended  up at Opium and for good reason, as they do so many things quite well!"
0,T S.,Opium,Ambiance is stunning. Live music on a Guzheng. Fabulous service. Delicious food. On a busy happening street in the heart of KL. Walking distance from many hotels. A must when in KL.
0,Kevin W.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock Kopitiam is the true 1Malaysia. Just by judging by its name, you can guess that they serve all three Chinese, Malay, Indian cuisine under one roof. To my understanding, they were once were with a famous nasi lemak place in PJ and they branched out to start their own kopitiam.
I'd say the nasi lemak here is actually really good although it is pretty pricey. At the same time, the meehun soto here is quite good too.
The Hainanese chicken rice and chicken chop are really good too.
This place is famous for lunch and to find parking in the area is close to impossible.
Service here is pretty fast as most of the food has a fast preparation time and their nasi lemak is already ready.
Their price is rather reasonable, all about RM10-RM15 there about."
0,Hannah E.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","First breakfast in KL had to be nasi lemak ayam, and I chose to get it here, where they seems very surprised anyone was ordering chicken at 8am. Everyone else in the place was scarfing their sweet egg toasts and milky coffee.

It took them forever to get it out; I think it was the first order of the day. To be fair, they warned me it would take ten minutes, and, well, my bad for forgetting what southeast Asians mean by ten minutes (35 minutes). But when it came out, it was worth it. Scorching hot freshly fried tender chicken pieces, tiny fish, peanuts, and a pile of deep red savory spicy sambal to mix it with the saturated coconut rice. Just a very satisfying mix.

Topped off by an excellent barley milk tea which was the first non-oversugared specimen I'd ever had, I was well fueled to complete a hot day of walking!"
0,Mansa C.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","For the 3rd time I've experienced completely incompetent service. Their staff cannot handle large crowds at all. Food and drinks come randomly and one friend waited more than 40 minutes before his food showed up, the  rest of us had finished eating at this point. To be honest the food isn't worth the wait.

If there is more than a few people here stay the hell away. Their kitchen can't cope."
0,Muhi L.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",Perfect representation of old school Malaysia. Highly recommend their Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng . Fast and very clean
0,Vanessa O.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","The name of this place is already giving you hint of the cuisines that you can find in Malaysia and yes, it is a mixture of Malay, Indian and Chinese cuisines - 1Malaysia so to speak.  Located near to the Petaling Street, there are plenty of parking spaces available here, but if it is at night, you should be extra careful as that area is slightly notorious - gangs are around that area to seek money if you are looking for parking spaces.

The interior offers a vintage feel where the paints are scrap off - and the partially run down look was one of their main selling point of this kopitiam concept. My favourite is definitely their nasi lemak and it is definitely one of the best that I've ever had so far!

This place is a nice place to hang-out and enjoy local cuisine which is a good place for locals, students as well as tourist to have their meal here. Price? Definitely reasonable!! Go ahead and order the Nasi Lemak here!! Highly recommended"
0,Wai Min K.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","We stumbled upon this kopitiam and really, I'm so glad we did! I was so drawn and attracted by the name of this kopitiam - Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock, which are respectively, very typical Malay, Indian and Chinese names. I really like the setting of this kopitiam - it's a good mix of old and new. And also, they were playing a mix of Malay, Indian and Chinese songs - I thought that was really awesome! Okay, I might have gotten a little bit excited when they played Zee Avi and Zainal Abidin...

Anyway, as for the food - well, we only had the lontong (RM8) and Hainanese chicken chop (RM14). I thought the lontong was okay, but I really enjoyed the Hainese chicken chop! I will definitely be back for more!"
0,Sandra Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","As the name suggests, Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock (AMAH) Kopitiam is definitely a foodstop for all time favourite Malaysian cuisines where you get the famous Malay, the Chinese and Indian foods under one roof. It can be said that this Kopitiam symbolises Malaysian diversity and that our love for food brings us all together. It's situated near the police station and right beside Old China Cafe.

Throughout my meal, they were playing songs sung and composed by Malaysian talents. It's definitely living up to its Malaysian image.

The bowl of lontong I ordered was huge! At least the portion was huge for me. Other than that, the nasi impit (rice cake) wasn't great, it was too tough and the texture was as if it was refrigerated before serving. The sayur lodeh (a coconut based soup) was not bad though, with a generous portion of vegetables. All of these going for RM8 only.

The Hailam Chicken Chop was slightly above mediocre. The juicy chicken chop served with tomato sauce and beans with some fries and sliced vegetables on the side. Sadly, the fries were limp and too salty for my liking. This plate of chicken chop costs RM14.

I would have ordered the Nasi Lemak instead if I knew that AMAH is well-known for it. I guess I'll just have to revisit to try its infamous dish.

Also, AMAH has a branch in Oasis Ara Damansara for those who live around that area."
0,Juan S.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",We ordered the Roti Jala. Comes with chicken curry. Flavor is very aromatic and not too spicy. Kampung Nasi goreng is good. Topped with fried egg. This place is jammed with lunch crowd. Will be back for more. The interior decor is very nice like mama store.
0,Grace Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",We had a rather large breakfast here one morning. Great nasi lemak. We also had the roti with chicken. I have never had these kind of stringy roti before and it was delicious. Highly recommended if you are in for some real Malaysian food.
0,Bathori T.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Came here just for nasi lemak, well it is not as tho, the ayam is crispy and the sauce is tasty"
0,Arnab B.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock",They are fabulous. A little difficult to locate at first but man they are amazing. Just try everything on their menu as I was tempted to do but of course you can only eat that much. What a fabulous experience from start to finish. Quaint little gem.
0,Fairuz Z.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","One of the very little known places in Petaling Street area, this kopitiam has it own attractions among backpackers communities. The food obviously, authentic malaysian. Love their roti jala and nasi lemak! I wish they served ABC or Cendol too."
0,Ivan L.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Nasi Lemak is currently listed as one of the healthiest breakfast by Time magazine.
The famous nasi lemak here is a must try, served with fried chicken marinated with herb n spices.

The food 4/5

Service 4/5"

0,Jason Y.,"Ali, Muthu & Ah Hock","Well known for their Malaysian food, Ali, Muthu, Ah Hock seems like one of those newly hyped Malaysian cuisine restaurant. After all, how many places are able to actually produce good Malaysian food right? I tried it to see how well they could amaze my tastebuds and boy was I not disappointed. Their Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng is definitely not overrated over here and is really good. As a fan of nasi  lemak, I've tried many places and I must say this is one of the really good ones. Chicken is hot and freshly fried but not overcooked so its still really juicy with crispy chicken skin. I also tried the kerang curry which is cockles in curry and it was alright although the cockles wasnt quite as big and juicy as i wouldve liked. Prices here are slightly on the high side for Malaysian food with an average of Rm10 and above so not the cheapest place to eat but its definitely worth a try."
0,Louis H.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Authentic flavor, guaranteed not to be able to found else where.

You just got to try the soup noodle, and the chicken chop. Will not be disappointed. It's cheap yet astounding flavored!

Shop is abit old but it's part of the culture."
0,Andrew B.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"We ate here as a family of four speaking no Malay at all and was pleasantly surprised. Staff were helpful and food was good.
Had a variety of different dishes that included Chinese rice, quail, garlic naan and roti. Kids can be picky but they enjoyed this also.
Lucky we got in about 6:30 as by 7:30 the place was full
Would eat here again, whole meal and four drinks only came to about $35r"
0,Jasmine C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It's my first time at the new place and despite the difficulty in parking nearby, I'm liking the new place. A lot more spacious and brighter.

Service was very quick, with menus passed to us as soon as we sat down. We also didn't have to wait too long for the food to be served. Had the Hainanese pork chop and when it came, the portion was very decent and I found it quite tasty. Not as dry as I worried it would be.

The Lum Mee was also not bad, a bit bland to start but easily remedied with black vinegar. I also have fond memories of this place's roti babi and marble cake. All in all, a nice walk down memory lane when dining here."
0,Shuen P.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee is a restaurant that serves traditional Hailam style breakfast and lunch. I use to work nearby and Yut Kee is one of my favourite lunch time places. I start off with their classic famous chicken chop, pork chop, roti babi, hokkien mee, Cantonese style noodles, fish porridge, noodle soup and many others until I tried their belacan fried rice. I'm a very loyal person, once I'm into something, I'll always order the same dish. Belacan fried rice is my favourite dish in Yut Kee and my drink will always be their barley lime. Most people are purposely there on Friday for their ""famous"" roasted pork roll but I find it a little overrated and very overpriced.

Whenever I am there for lunch, I usually take away their kaya roll to snack on during tea time. Most people prefer their butter cake but I'm more into their kaya roll.
Other than lunch, sometimes I am there early in the morning before work for their breakfast too. Usually I will have their traditional half boiled eggs with steamed bread sometimes their fish porridge. A good day always starts with good breakfast."
0,Jay Sern C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Roasted pork, roti Babi (pork bread), pork chop, Hainanese noodle and toast bread are good!

Service is good too!

Prepare to wait for 15-30min

Highly recommended!"
0,Penny W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee is definitely one of the oldest operating Hailam restaurants in town. It doesn't only offer main course meals but cakes too. I went there around 11 am and it is almost full house, nonetheless we managed to get a spot. After our food is served, people started waiting outside of the restaurant already. There are many chairs available to sit while waiting for your turn. So I advice you be early, if you want to eat there!

I got to try fish and chips, pork chop and chicken chop. The portion is definitely worthy for the price! One of the most famous dishes is pork chop but unfortunately, it was disappointing for me. The meat was tough and I had hard time chewing it. For the other two dishes, I quite enjoy it but the fried fish fillet is a tad too oily.

Oh right, I forget to mention that it is very difficult to find parking. There was once, I went almost 5 rounds around the area just to get a parking spot."
0,Eugene L.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"This is probably one of the earliest Hainanese Coffee Shops in Kuala Lumpur, this place is also called ""Jacks"" if I remembered it correctly from my dad. This place is famous for their Kaya Rolls and Marble Cakes (Although lately their quality has been on a decline lately, but it's still nice though).

This place is usually packed during breakfast and lunch hours as it is frequent by people working nearby. Their signature dishes are Belacan Fried Rice, Roti Babi, Hainanese Chicken/pork chops, Pork Roast and fish porridge.

My personal favourite here has got to be their Chicken Chop which I can finish 2 servings by myself (It doesn't mean I'm a glutton, maybe their portion is a little too small?). Other than that, I would say the beauty about having to dine here is actually the environment, it is about the most authentic experience you can find in KL if you're looking for old fashion/vintage Chinese Coffee Shop, This is IT!"
0,Julian O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"I've been coming here for the past 5 years now even when they used to be in the much smaller coffee shop that could barely fit 10 tables. The Hainanese Chicken Chop and Hailam Mee are the clear standouts here - you'll be hard pressed to find either dish in all of KL and both dishes couldn't be executed any better here. The Chicken Chop comes with the most tender chicken thigh ever with a light, delicate brown sauce. The Hailam Mee packs a punch of flavor - salty with the right balance of sweetness. Perfect for a hearty breakfast. Get 2 dishes if you're hungry."
0,Stan N.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Very welcoming and warm service at this eatery. Very patient and friendly wait staff and owner. Came here for the famous Roti Babi and I was not disappointed. The Roti is nicely toasted and it is warm, soft and fluffy. Within it is a nicely seasoned filling of pork (hence Babi) and onions. Wished I could eat more but I also ordered the Hailam Mee which was also good and had a good portion of pork lard! Yums! Must come back for the chicken chop which I noticed comes with a side of toast."
0,Sue F.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"I love this place because of the nostalgia factor. I was a little sad when they moved to their new location last year, but I found the food to be of the same quality. The pork chops were still as good, and the Hailam mee was still slippery and slimy as I remembered it.

My favourite here will always be the marble cake. Typical to Hainanese style cakes, it's oilier than some people are used to but I absolutely devour it every time I make a visit. Amazingly, the owners also managed to keep the setting of the place similar by reusing the furniture they had in the previous lot.

Yut Kee will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope never to see it go."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"The legendary Yut Kee had been moved from the front row shop beside the main road to this shop behind around a year ago, but nothing about the crowd has changed. That's even if you are here at 8 in the morning for breakfast, the crowd is still there, mainly comprised of those who are working nearby.

If you are here during Friday and the weekends, which is when they are serving their infamous pork loin - be here even earlier as their pork loin runs out pretty quickly! That being said, yes - they don't do serve this on the other weekdays, so note this to avoid any disappointment!

Lum mee is another of my repeated order when I'm here. Of course, this would just be my personal preference as the noodles they use to prepare their lum mee here is thicker than the usual lum mee's you would find elsewhere. And, if you are familiar with Yut Kee, you would know about their chicken chop as well - definitely evoke feelings of nostalgia with their sauce and each bite of it.

As they serve pork loin here as their signature dish, you would know that this place is non-halal. So, the next thing that I also like about the place would be their roti babi - a piece of toast coated with egg and heavily buttered and fried to golden brown, wrapping a full load of pulled pork prepared with a lot of onions with it. The owner told me that I should eat it with the L&P sauce, but I personally find it to be equally distinct tasting just on its own too.

Definitely a place that I wouldn't mind waking up early for their breakfast during weekends - a small and old shop with lots of comfort foods!"
0,Chong-Te O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It's hard to find good authentic traditional Malaysian Hainanese food these days, I have been coming to Yut Kee since I was a little boy, the family run business has stood the test of time and still going strong after all these years!!!"
0,Michelle C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"There is plenty of hype surrounding this place and one needs a lot of patience especially since the line is insanely long. When I went there on a Saturday afternoon, my family and I had to wait about an hour and a half to get in. The management has a very reliable waiting list system and there is a sating area for those who are waiting.

the food is good and lives up to its name. It is also very affordable. In my opinion their Lum Mee is one of the best dishes here, as well as their pork chop. Prices are reasonable."
0,Gladys Y.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"It was probably billions of years ago that my boyfriend first brought me to this pork chop place. He promised me it was going to be so delicious, and it is. We still go there regularly until now. :)

Previously, this place tried to maintain the essence of Malaysian heritage by not renovating their shop; the yellowish walls, the colourful windows and tiles, and even the antique furniture and cutleries. Eventually as the shop gets more and more famous, it failed to contain the number of visitors especially on weekends; making such a huge queue each time we pay a visit. However, in the end they renovated to a new bigger place now, still maintaining the heritage feel, but way less crowded and more organized. Good job, Yut Kee!

Our favourite dishes at the restaurant (and our staple orders) are the pork chop, kaya French toast, nasi goreng kampung, and we normally ""tapao"" their handmade kaya spread and kaya roll cake too. If you are planning to visit this shop anytime soon, please try these dishes I mentioned; they are seriously tasty that we can never eliminate even one dish each time we visit. ^_^ Price wise, it is not too expensive and totally worth it! My boyfriend and I normally spend around RM 60++ inclusive the foods we packed home. Go go go try if you haven't yet! :)"
0,Rebecca W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee has been around for ages, and they are famous for serving Hainanese cuisine. They have now moved to a new location at Jalan Kamunting in KL, and the place is still packed as usual.

One of the signature dishes is the Hainanese Chicken Chop - fried chicken topped with brown sauce, potatoes and mixed vegetables. The chicken was moist and I like the brown sauce a lot, it's very flavourful. I once tried the Pan Fried Mee Sua, and it was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much, but the mee sua was crispy and you can taste the fragrance of the garlic in it. I tasted very close to the ones my aunty used to make for me when I was young.

They serve some amazing kaya too - rich texture and not too sweet. With their amazing kaya, they serve some nice Kaya Swiss Roll too. The rolls were buttery and light, and the kaya filling was just heavenly.

Yut Kee is really a nice kopitiam to have some authentic Hainanese cuisine at a reasonable price. The downside would probably be the crowd, and the waiting time."
0,Evonne M.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,Not really the best place to get nice food in kl. I don't mind ordering the fried loh mee and skip the rest
0,Julian T.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Yut Kee has been around for such a long time now and people still crowd this classic place. I often visit during my lunch break from classes and that's when offices are off for lunch too, which makes it very hard to find seats. I usually just decide to park in the open carparks around there, I don't particularly remember which, but look for the ones with per-entry rates.

They are known for their Pork Chop and Bun (Roti Babi). I love the Pork Bun, it's a very greasy delight which you might regret devouring so many of it later. If you prefer non-pork options, they also have a Chicken Chop that tastes just as good. They also have dishes like Belacan Fried Rice and French Toast, which are delicious as well.

For some sweet delights, they are also famous for the Kaya Rolls here, but recently I felt like it doesn't taste as good anymore. Maybe it was just that day, I'll find out when I visit again."
0,Vanessa O.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Before this restaurant moved to their own new building, my mom used to stop by her car at the road side to buy us the kaya swiss rolls and those were the days reminiscing my teenage life. Since they have this new building and had made themselves into headlines, the restaurant had garnered enough media attention as well as the public's attention. Ever since, this place is filled with people and you will need to wait to be seated and not walk in as you like.

First you will expect a long queue but not to worry, there are plenty of chairs for you to sit while waiting. Expect to share tables with strangers - which I don't like! But that's the reality of this restaurant when it became famous. Once you place your order, you will be expected to eat and leave soon after. Since the queue is long outside (usually), people will just stare at you and make you feel uncomfortable.

Food quality wise is not fantastic anymore. Foreigners are cooking the meals these days and you can't expect for more. My favourite is the chicken chop and the toast bread. The noodles or chicken rice is not as good.

Once you finished your food, please make your payment at the counter."
0,Christine W.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,"Like walking into a corner of a bygone era.
We took the train and walked -- no parking, no problem.
They get busy so be prepared for a wait.
Order a variety of things, including the roti baba, soft boiled eggs etc."
0,Ann C.,Kedai Makanan Yut Kee,My favourite place ever! Food served almost immediately. Prices are cheap. Yes there is a wait and no reservations but turn over is quick. Be prepared to share tables with other guests. I recommend the hainanese Chicken Chop and also the roast pork during weekends. So many other choices from noodles to rice dishes. Authentic old school coffee shop feel. My childhood favourite. May be biased. But still my favourite place ever!
0,Ornnicha A.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"This is my second time in Hong kee. I was searching the best and authentic clatpot in KL for so long. This place won't let u disappointed.

We came here around 7.30. and we were in line for 1 hour. After we get the table, the food came. It was so good. We added more Chinese sagsage and salted fish.

The service was nice and friendly. When they saw me thried to take a picture of our group. They were trying to help us . They family and staff are cuteeee"
0,Alex P.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Definitely a great spot to try claypot chicken.  Food was super tasty and plentiful however you'll need to be on the look out for some bones with the chicken which isn't that big of a surprise for this type of cuisine.
0,L B.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"Really cool how they're able to replicate this dish outside.  Ive waited longer at a brick and brick for this dish.  Warning, the salty/salted fish is super pungent and salty.  You might want to get it without.  There are 3 different pot sizes.  For one, two, or three people.  The two will feed three.  Does that make sense lol who's on first?"
0,Suria N.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Earlier tonight we shared a table with another couple who were kind enough to let us sat together at their table. We had 2 claypot chicken rice with 'lap chong' or Chinese sausages. Just delicious. We love it. We complimented the dinner with young coconut. Perfect dinner for MYR34 or SGD11 for the two of us.
0,Vinay P.,Hong Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,Pretty good freshly cooked claypot chicken with cheap beers. Rice is nicely seasoned and slightly crispy. Unfortunately no vegetarian claypot options.
0,Kira N.,Restoran Kin Kin,"How did i ever go through life missing out on such an irresistible dish? This dish is none other than the OG chili pan mee at Restoran Kin Kin!!!

It was love at first bite for me when the flavor just plowed through like a wrecking ball! I'm not exaggerating. The dried fish with just the right amount of chili; along with the fried onions, and the perfectly soft, yet chewy noodles, gave my tastebuds their first ever wondrously unforgettable experience to last a lifetime. No one should go through life without experiencing this superbly flavorful dish. Don't be that one person, go here, get this, now!!!"
0,Angelo B.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Came here for bfast. I've never had pan mee before so don't have a benchmark, but I can say that the pan mee here is so good. Great combination of strong flavors. The chilli was extremely delicious too.

It's a hole in the wall type of place, and seemed to be full of locals.

It's a complete steal at only 8rng (approx 2usd).

I will try return."
0,Hannah E.,Restoran Kin Kin,"A great example of a place that does its one menu item perfectly. It doesn't need to add variety. If you want chili pan mee, you come here, and if you don't, you go elsewhere! Simple as that.

The dish itself is simple as well - noodles with anchovy pieces fried like bacon (at first I thought it was bacon), minced pork, and a soft boiled egg waiting to be cracked and its yolk used as a broth of sorts. The accompanying bowl of soft dark green leaves in a mild broth keeps you from burning yourself on the excessive table chili you're guaranteed to put in after you taste how good it is. It's so good that people apparently try to buy it straight, because the owner has written on the tile wall in Sharpie that he doesn't sell it separately!"
0,Andrea W.,Restoran Kin Kin,"This restaurant is located in a really random place and the place is really small and shabby. But, I came here for the chili pan mee, and it was delicious. The bowl of noodles was quite small, and in it were noodles, meat sauce, and an egg. Soup came on the side, and there was chili on each table for additional spice and flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles, and I highly recommend it! This could also serve as a snack as the portions are quite small (or get two bowls)."
0,Chang L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"A great example of small shop hospitality. The noodles were definitely good, but what takes the cake is how much the owner cares about his business and customers. Walking into this unassuming little shop with prices written on the walls I wasn't expecting much, maybe even a little less. Instead I was overwhelmed by how pleasant the owner was. He helped us order our meals, was attentive and obviously so proud of his noodles. He deserves 5 stars all the way."
0,ChauPha N.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Me and the boyfriend visit Restoran Kin Kin while we were on vacation in Malaysia. We checked Yelp and noticed that this place have a lot of good reviews and so we decided to stop in. The chili pan mee also look delish. When we first walk in, there will be someone to tell you to take a seat, then you just order your drinks and wait for the chili pan mee to come out. So that explains why Restoran Kin Kin doesn't have a menu because they only offer chili pan mee. For drinks, they offer herbal tea and also whatever soft drinks they have in the cooler.

I really liked my chili pan mee. The noodle is definitely homemade and the taste speak for itself. Portion size it's kinda small, if you have a big appetite, you might need to order another bowl.

Overall, I would recommend Restoran Kin Kin."
0,Karen T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"This is a chili pan mee institution. Love the texture of their homemade noodles to the spiciness of their chili flakes and the creaminess of their poached egg.

Definitely a must have when you are in the heart of KL and worth braving the jam for."
0,佩,Restoran Kin Kin,"At first, I was very happy that I can finally find a place to eat noodle in Kuala Lumpur. I was so excited to come here. However, first of all, they did not ask my friend and my permission if we can let other people to sit with us at a round table (which usually should be for us). They just suddenly let two person to sit down at the same table with us. The waiter service was very bad, he did not know English, and never gave us any menu and asked us what to eat. We asked for menu for a long time, but he never gave us as he did not understand English. We are foreigner around here, I did not know any menu over here. At last, he did not wait for our confirmation and placed the noodle to the chef which we did not even know what were our order were. The noodle which the waiter placed was just ok, not the best, but not too bad either, that's why I am giving 2 star for this review. Other than this, everything was bad. I am very disappointed about this local food restaurant in Malaysia."
0,Cat T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Of all the dishes my friend and I ate during out trip to Malaysia, we both agreed the dry Chili Pan Mee noodles at Restoran Kin Kin was the best. We ate this savory noodle dish at Kin Kin and also at another restaurant that is right across the street. Hands down Restoran Kin Kin was way better. The noodles were glutinous and chewy, the sauce had a perfect balance of seasonings, and the poached egg was done just right. The dish basically comes with a side of soup that was simple and good too. My friend and I didn't know how the order because their wasn't any menu, but shortly after we sat down the waiter just gave us the ""dry"" version. Later we saw on the wall you can order the dry or soup version."
0,Shuen P.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin Pan Mee is one of my favorite lunch time places back when I am working in Kuala Lumpur. It is about 10 minutes' walk from my workplace but me and my colleagues still goes there for lunch despite having to walk under hot scorching sun because we love their chilli pan mee. But not to the extent of stealing their chilli. For your information, there are pictures of people stealing their chilli displayed on their wall despite having CCTV installed. Besides chilli pan mee, they also serve 'yong liu' (mixtures of fuchuk, fish balls and meat balls).

To me, the only downside about this place is their ventilation system. The shop is hot and stuffy but it is worth it because I love their chilli pan mee. Even though I'm no longer working in Kuala Lumpur, sometime I still go back for their chilli pan mee."
0,Sue F.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I love Kin Kin because they make the best chilli pan mee in KL. The uncle who owns the shop makes the noodle from scratch, and he makes the chilli mix at the shop every morning. The chilli, which I always add sparingly, is the star of this dish. It's really hot so try a little first and add more as you go. And the poached egg on top is just the thing so that the whole dish is not too dry. The sweet potato leaf soup on the side is also good!

Oh, there's another Kin Kin outlet at Publika food court but nothing beats the taste of the noodles at the original shop.A lot of shops try to copy the style and quality of Kin Kin but they're not even close. The uncle once told me that he's flattered that a lot of people try to copy him but he's also upset because they don't credit him."
0,YongJie L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin Pan Mee is the best Chilies Pan Mee in the town! Well, at least I believe so, but they are very famous with the chilies Pan Mee. I came to know about this restaurant was introduced by my colleagues, we took LRT and walked all the way there (so it is that good that we are willing to walk that far).

The first impression was ""why no air cond T_T"", as I was sweating like hell after the long walk. The restaurant looks like those typical chinese kopitiam and it is quite stuffy inside, I think it was because of the crowd. I even spotted some customers eating with their blazer on. So, i was thinking this must be damn good. And, it turns out, i really love their Chillies Pan Mee. Something that i think it differs from others chillies pan mee in the town is the noodles. It is so good and smooth with the porched eggs. They do have a branch in the Publika Food court, the taste doesn't have a big difference from the main branch. So, the original taste vs air cond, i chose air cond.. Publika Food Court has became my another dinner spot."
0,Qui C.,Restoran Kin Kin,"My husband and I came during an off-hour and there was no wait and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. They make one thing: chili pan mee. All I did was raise up my hand and showed the older Chinese gentleman 2 fingers and within a few minutes, two bowls of chili pan mee came out. I absolutely loved this dish, with lots of chili. This was my husband's favorite meal during our trip."
0,Grace Y.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Only one item on the menu and basically that's what you have to get. But boy do they do it right. The noodle was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was meaty and flavorful. I am definitely a fan."
0,Andy S.,Restoran Kin Kin,Was surprised how good this was. Great texture of the homemade noodles. One dish restaurant done very well.
0,Ah M.,Restoran Kin Kin,"So it's s battle between Kin Kin vs Super Kitchen (across of Kin Kin). Both are good in my books but somehow, Kin Kin has the upper hand.

The place is newly renovated, I like the old decor more, minus the rusty and oil crusted kitchen equipment. Nothing a spoonful of cili can't fix though. A favourite of mine."
0,Maggie T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I would say I prefer Face 2 Face.

They are kinda famous for their Chilli Pan Mee, but well, maybe not really to the taste I'm looking for.

Well yes they are more established and do have a more traditional way of cooking it, I'm sorry but I still like F2F :( I find that the texture here is more towards the softer version.

The place look pretty old and vintage-ish, I really recommend that they refurbish the place to have a cleaner and tidier look. The alleys and everything else looked kind of dodgy. So it might attract dengue or maybe rats and cockroaches.... Who knows man. Pricing of the noodles here are about the average reasonable price. Choices for drinks are not many.

Well to be honest parking here might be an issue if you come during peak hours. There are lots of car workshops around that area. So make sure you don't park your car at the reserved spot. There are parking lots available at the back of the shop. You can park your car there."
0,Eugene L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"I am a self proclaimed die-hard fan of chili pan mee lover, and Kin Kin Pan Mee is probably the holy grail of Chili Pan Mee as they are the real originators of this awesome delicacy. Kin Kin Pan Mee is situated in one of the shoplots between chow kit and jalan sultan ismail, this place is usually packed on any given day (even weekdays). Almost every time I visited this place, I would usually eat two bowls of chili pan mee (they are just too awesome!).

If you don't believed my words, do you know there is actually people came over for a meal and then stole the whole tub of dry chillies home and to an extent the owner got no choice but to install CCTV cameras in the shop to deter crazy customers. If you have not tried chili pan mee before, I highly recommend you to visit this restaurant at all costs, so that you can truly savour the real chili pan mee and it really is good!"
0,Ian L.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Pan mee lovers surely know this place. Famed for its chilli pan mee, this unassuming shop in Kampung Baru is our favorite pan mee in town. The springy flour noodles topped with a soft, poached egg, minced pork, crunchy anchovies.
  The secret of this dish is the unlimited supply of dry, pan-roasted chilli flakes. Be prepared to wait for at least 15 mins to 30 mins for your dish though."
0,Julian T.,Restoran Kin Kin,"Kin Kin is probably one of the popular Chilli Pan Mee shops in town. It's actually my first CPM and man did I fell in love with it. Amongst all the CPM shops around, I feel that Kin Kin has the best and most flavored chilli. The chilli here actually gives the noodles part of its taste, whereas other places' chilli are only used to add the spiciness.

Another delicious dish that you should order here is the Pork Balls. Its a wonderful side dish that goes perfectly with your bowl of noodles. It's safe to say that I visit this place at least once a week and I'll never stop. The CPM here only comes in one size, so you just have to say how many bowls that you want, instead of choosing the size."
0,Horton L.,Songket Restaurant,"We eat thousands of meals throughout our lives, we forget most of them but there is always a few dishes that you will never forget. This is one of these meals for me.

After a relaxing 6 hour couple massage with the wife, we were so relaxed and ofcourse hungry. We looked up on the phone to see what was around to eat. Fortunately Songket was right next door tucked away in the back of an ally that had great reviews. So glad we went because it was a life changing experience.

We were there about 40 minutes before closing and was afraid they had nothing but pan drips left for us to lick on. But that was not the case at all.

Our friendly waiters seated us with a smile, they didn't act like we were there before they were about to close was an inconvenience to them, they acted like we were the only VIP customers that they had been waiting all day long. They quickly apologized the fact that we had just missed a live Malaysian dance show in the courtyard- bummer.

We decided to sit in the courtyard anyway, because it was decorated perfectly- the little urban tropical oasis. It was a late feb night so it was perfect temperature (however we did get a few mosquito bite). Our food experience was magic. Everything we had that night was delicious. Their food really put American restaurant scene to shame. We had a delicious appetizer, Malaysian prawns in spicy coconut sauce, some famous beef dish as our main course. We ordered two cocktails that were not only tasty, but also looked like art. All the flavor exploded in our mouths and it was a perfect ending to our spa day.

This place is a MUST if you are in Kuala Lumpur and I will for sure be back next time I'm in KL!!"
0,Kin C.,Songket Restaurant,"Great experience here! Delicious satay that is soft and flavorful, giant prawns in a coconut sauce that is reminscient of Tom yum soup but less spicy, and a chef special rice that is fragrant and sweetened with coconut. The starfruit juice was fresh. Prices are middle of the road, you can search for the menu online.

We went on a Wednesday night right on time for their 8pm show. Some traditional dances with music and other entertainment. Guests are encouraged to participate in using a blowdart and jumping over bamboo.

Friendly service, they helped me call a cab on the app."
0,Victor K.,Songket Restaurant,"Touristy but great fun. Typical Malaysian dishes. Great food; service a bit slow but packed so understood. Good value. The owner, Philip, walks around meeting guests. The owner, Philip walks around meeting guests and checking on orders.
Traditional dancing was a nice touristy touch."
0,Yusuke M.,Songket Restaurant,"I went when I had a 4 days tour in Malaysia, because of my colleague's recommendation. Malaysia traditional foods are very tasty and the dance is very nice. I recommend you if you want to enjoy Malaysia foods and dance."
0,Lucy Y.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"Delicious!  Super reasonably priced, too.  Our tour driver recommended this place to us and as soon as we took a bite of the spicy sauced rice, we understood why.  I had a fried chicken leg and it was juicy & perfect.  We loved it!!"
0,Dea D.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"I been here once. I wondered why was so many people queued. I joined and found a seat. I ate with my friends while enjoying the environment. 9.9/10 for Nasi Lemak. Really really great I swear. It's warm, delicious, the sambal also was also spicy, sweet, and in a big portion. Great while enjoying the environment. Totally recommend it!"
0,Alfie C.,Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa,"I've been a fan of Nasi Lemak when I was a kid. I remember when I was staying at UK for 7 months. Nasi Lemak is the first thing that came across my mind that moment. It's not hard to find Nasi Lemak these days when you are staying abroad. There are too many Malaysian restaurants in most of the countries and I bet all of them got Nasi Lemak on their menu. Well, Nasi Lemak has go international for a long time but here in Kampung Baru, they got a Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa of their own. You don't have to go abroad these days just have the international nasi lemak.

Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa has been in service for most of Malaysian stomachs for quite some times. There are various types of Nasi Lemak on the menu. Well, that's the reason I been there. Not because of some western cuisines or Nasi Kerabu, it is because of Nasi Lemak. I ordered a plate of Beef Nasi Lemak and I'm really satisfied with the result that came onto my table. A plate of extravaganza that include a medium portion of coconut rice, boiled egg, fried anchovies and cow lungs and also 'bergedil'.

They are quite generous in giving their sambal paste as well. It is something that we like from any food sellers. I heard that they already have few branches outside KL area as well but I'm not pretty sure."
0,Trena M.,Cantaloupe,"I can here for Sunday brunch, and the food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the view was stunning. Brunch was tapas style, with a set menu but you can pretty much order however much you'd like. Brunch was pricey, but with plenty of seafood and meat (baby squid, eel, lamb and beef)c, I can see why! Everything was very fresh and you can tell the food is quite high quality. My favorite was the poached egg with tomato and avocado, and I wish they had some more non-seafood and meat options. Even so, I was stuffed by the end of it. Having the sweet tooth that I have, I couldn't resist trying all the deserts. My favorites were the rice pudding and semolina cake, neither of which were overly sweet.

Portions are small, so it's perfect for tasting a bit of everything and re-ordering your favorites. I definitely want to come back in the evening, when the city is lit up."
0,Abby H.,Cantaloupe,It's absolutely amazing and the service is top notch.  We had the Degustation menu and I love every dish. It interesting and tasty combination of ingredients put together beautifully. Highly recommend.  Would come back again to try out their 8 courses lunch menu
0,Julie Y.,Cantaloupe,"Again, one of those fancy restaurants I'll never be able to afford on my own but thanks to my job, I've had the opportunity to dine at Cantaloupe. The first thing you'll notice is how quiet the place is, where you'll automatically walk a little slower, talk a little softer and eat a little more daintier. Start your meal with a pre-drink at the bar at Claret and soak in the majestic sight.

Cantaloupe offers a spectacular view of KL city and the twin towers, just dining by the dazzling lights alone is enough to impress your partner here. Food is an innovation here where the chef experiments with various elements, never failing to inject that wow factor whether it's the presentation or taste of the dish. Carnivores should not miss out on the wagyu beef steak, a heavenly mix of textures and flavours.

The selection of wine and champagne here is rather extensive so you'll feel obliged to pop open a bottle to justify the beautiful ambiance. Just be sure to take lots of photos!"
0,Ian L.,Cantaloupe,"Easily one of the best fine dining restaurants in town, Cantaloupe is where you go when you have some money to spend.
   Stylishly-outfitted with minimal designs, the place also offers a stunning view of KL skyline. The menu, curated by talented chef Chris Bauer is a delight. The express lunch set is a good way to learn more about the fine dining spot, at an affordable price.
   There are too many dishes that are stand-outs here (eg. foie gras sate with peanut butter sauce). But for your money, best splurge on their seasonal or degustation menu. Everything is beautifully executed and carefully curated. For special occasions, we highly recommend Cantaloupe."
0,Cedric C.,Cantaloupe,"As a big supporter of the molecular gastronomy movement, I've got nothing but praises for Chef Bauer's Cantaloupe. Modern fine dining with a creative concept, excellent wine, attentive service. Great place to celebrate a special occasion. Favourite dish was actually the deconstructed creme brûlée reminding us of a grant achatz creation. The dining scene in KL has grown significantly over the years and this is proof."
0,YongJie L.,Cantaloupe,"Cantaloupe, a fine dining restaurant located in the KL city with the best night view of KLCC. So, please be prepared for the price as well. I will not walk into such a place for usual dining as it is so expensive (I am not living a luxury life, LOL!).

I was there for a special occasion, my anniversary with my boyfriend. So, we thought of doing somewhere special to celebrate this special day. After googled a few places, we made up our mind to try out Cantaloupe, mostly due to the KLCC night view and the reviews are quite positive. The night was fantastic. I love the ambience in Cantaloupe, very grand and classy, quiet yet romantic, I think the best place for couples. The service was really good. The waiters were very friendly and able to give advices and good recommendation while we were asking for wine. The food were good and interesting. I was quite impressed by one of the starter, which looked like foams but actually taste very good. We took some photos outside of the restaurant after meal. I love everything in that night, it is a nice place, just a bit too pricey. :)"
0,Azraai A.,Cantaloupe,"I recently went on a date with a guy and knowing guys, they would always want to impress you on the first date right? Well this guy takes the cake. He asked me to pick a place and I said that I was fine with anything so he said he wanted to take me to Cantaloupe.

I arrived a little late due to Friday traffic and he was already waiting for me at the bar, we then proceeded to our table on the balcony outside, they don't usually serve food there but since were both smokers, they made an exception.

The wine list was impressive and we had a few dishes to share during dinner. The place was very classy indeed, you could almost taste the Champagne in the air. The wait staff was attentive and quick and surprisingly good looking. The food was very tasty, we had the baby squid amongst other things but I would recommend the spinach and cheese Bruschetta, I haven't tasted anything quite as phenomenal as that (I later tried to make my own at home but it didn't taste quite the same. Must have been all the adrenalin pumping through my veins that night.)

Well, we didn't go on a second date after that, you know how it is, we just didn't click over Baby Squid and Bruschetta."
0,Joe F.,Cantaloupe,"I absolutely love this restaurant. It is at least as good as a one-star Michelin. The tasting menu was large and varied at ridiculously low prices. The food was excellent, reminiscent of The Tapas Molecular (at the top of the Tokyo Mandarin Oriental), without the ""show"" but with much more flexibility on choosing menu items and much better availability for reservations. The view was spectacular - twin towers right out the large windows. The in-house smoked salmon was by far the best I have ever had in my long life.  This is a must do bucket-list restaurant if you ever find yourself in Kuala Lumpur. I might go back just to visit this restaurant again!"
0,Mat M.,Bijan,"The Bijan Restaurant in Kuala Lampur didn't disappoint!  Our hotel, the Intercontinental recommended it as a great local spot and made us a reservation.  We arrived and everything was prepared for us.  We had the Chicken Satay as a starter - and then had several local entrees.  We enjoyed 2 bottles of wine - and one of each of the desserts.  The service was fantastic from start to finish.  The cost was very affordable - and we were impressed how much food we got for the cost.

I would not hesitate to visit again in the future."
0,Chaza A.,Bijan,Great food and service. Loved the ambiance. The people were so friendly and ready to take care of us. The food was very tasteful. You gotta eat here!
0,Stephanie S.,Bijan,"Yum! I really liked this place. It was a good stop for our last dinner in Kuala Lumpur. The place has white tablecloths and a wine list. I got a fancy drink, a pineapple gin drink. It was pretty good. We got the vegetable fritter for an appetizer. It was really tasty and came with a spicy dipping sauce. For dinner I had Australian beef simmered in banana leafs which made kind of a curry. It was delicious. We also shared some Nasi Lemak rice and sautéed ferns with shrimp. We also had dessert which was a small warm cake with a shot of sugarcane poured over it and some coconut ice cream. Everything was delicious and the service was good. The whole meal cost about RM 350 or about $90 USD. Overall, it was a good stop."
0,Jimmy L.,Bijan,"Yelp isn't the place to come to reviews for restaurants in SE Asia (or probably anywhere outside of the US), so take mine with a grain of salt too because I clearly confided a bit too much in the ones before mine.

This restaurant based off yelp reviews and experience seems to be a family style tourist trap and yet here I am as a tourist, posting a yelp review. Bijan is deemed as a high quality restaurant (maybe it is, maybe it isn't) that failed to deliver.

I had the Ayam Masak Merah, chicken simmered in sweet/spicy blends that took me about a month to chew through each piece. Flavor wasn't bad though. Also had their seabass fillets that were served in a turmeric curry which although very flavorful, came with many surprise pieces of bones still in the fillets that perhaps I was too overzealous in expecting to be removed prior to.

If you're not into eating like the locals where you sit outside, occasionally eat with your hands, etc. etc.- then perhaps Bijan is for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in the culture and eat some real Malaysian food, do yourself a favor and skip Bijan.

The ambiance, service and price in USD was not bad but if you're in KL to have good food for a fraction of the price (and when I say fraction, think 1 as the numerator and a high number as the denominator).. Go to Jalan Alor or something and eat anything there- you're welcome in advance."
0,Yanoh J.,Bijan,"Loved this place! Now, it has 3 dollar signs, and I guess for Malaysia standards it is expensive. However, I had one of the more expensive items on the menu, wine, as well as an appetizer and my bill was less than $30 USD. So for a tourist it is extremely affordable. Service was amazing and quick here, the duck wasn't crispy as advertised but still very delicious. Spring rolls were amazing. My only regret is that I didn't find this place sooner."
0,Linda L.,Bijan,"My travel buddy and I found this place on yelp with a good amount of positive reviews.  Went to inquire it with our hotel concierge, they agreed it was the place to go so went and gave it a try.  The decor and ambiance was wonderful.  The service was great.  Our server was very attentive, each time our water and/or cocktail glass was near empty, he will come and ask if we wanted something else to drink.  As we were leaving, they even helped us get a taxi (taxi's are tricky in Kuala Lumpur).  However, the food was just mediocre and the price was definitely ex-pat / tourist price, on the high end.  We ordered two shrimp dishes with very different description and we must admit, the two dishes looked and tasted very similar.  The drinks were weak but they looked very pretty.  
Ambiance + Service + Cleanliness = 5 stars
Food + Price = 2 stars
Overall, I'll give it a 5 star experience.  If you want a nice and clean place to enjoy some Malaysian food with excellent service, I would recommend it.  If you're looking for some cost effective and tasty food, this place isn't it."
0,John W.,Bijan,"Food is spectacular! True ingredients and clearly almost everything is handmade. Totally impressed with the food, and the atmosphere is also very refreshing! Ambiance with the breeze and music is simply wonderful. This is a return to kind of place to try all they have to offer! Prices are also on point for what you get... it's Not overpriced at all. Almost feels like I stole from them based on what I paid for the quality of what I got!"
0,David B.,Bijan,Fantastic Malaysian dinner at a beautiful restaurant which throws a modern twist on traditional dishes. Friendly and helpful staff make this a great location for anyone new to the cuisine.
0,Jim D.,Bijan,"Fancy modern Maylay cuisine done extremely well.  Excellent service, good ambiance.  It is, however, rather expensive.  Excellent date night or expense account meal."
0,Peter L.,Bijan,"Bijan is a great place to try Malaysian fare in a stylish location and with a slightly modern twist.  The dining room is dark and spacious with an outdoor section as well.  We started off with a couple of classic apps - Popiah and otak otak.  The Popiah was ok but nothing special.  Better yet was the Popiah.  The Opor Rusuk was massive and beef ribs accompanied by a nice sauce of coconut and spices was wonderful.  Kerabu Mangga is the Malay answer to the Thai mango salad, and the version here is delicious - sweet, spicy, sour all at the same time.  There are some decent wine options as well and overall, I would definitely recommend Bijan for local food in a nice setting.  Plus it's also quite close to Bukit Bintang for plenty of after dinner options."
0,Vanessa O.,Bijan,"It was our monthly celebration but this time was for Raya. All ladies were dressed up in traditional Malay costume just for this occasion. It was a fun thought to be honest! Well we are usually dressed smart or at least smart casual. Although I'm not a fan of spicy delicacies, my own view was this place is the best place to go around. Food is good, comfortable ambience.

I was told that this place is usually the hangout place for tourist or foreigners (usually expats) to come around for a good meal of Malay cuisine. Personally I would think that it is expensive to savour Malay cuisine, but well, foreigners or tourist deserve to see what Malaysia / Malay cuisine can offer. This place offers real authentic cuisines!!
Parking wasn't that difficult, there is valet in operation, but you would expect to pay RM10 per car - which is quite expensive.

NO surprise that the menu can turn out to be slightly more pricey that any other Malay casual restaurant that you dine - again, you can't compare this place with those.. Again, I reckon this is slight upper class.

If you have friends that visits you from abroad, try to bring them here!!"
0,Vio L.,Bijan,"It's a nice place, the food is good and the atmosphere is relaxing. Avoid the durian cheesecake unless you know for a fact you like this fruit. I didn't mind the smell before, but 3 bites in and I had to throw in the napkin, can't be anywhere around durian ever since.

This restaurant is about 3 times as expensive as KL's average, but the food and service are not quite following the price tag."
0,Anna-Marie M.,Bijan,"Our first exposure to Malaysian food. This was fantastic. The atmosphere was gorgeous, service was great and the food was indescribable.
We ate so much it hurt but it was all so good I didn't want to stop.
I highly recommend the coconut creme caramel. I could eat it for every meal. So decadent!!"
0,B D.,Bijan,"Bijan is a great place to discover and enjoy Malaysian foods in a fine dining setting. We've been twice and intend to go many more times. Every dish we've tried has been fantastic except the otak otak (fish pate appetizer) which was just okay. It's worth trying the desserts, even the durian ones (cheesecake or chocolate cake). If you don't like durian in these wonderful desserts, I don't think you'll like durian in any form.

The wines are decent, the atmosphere is lovely and the staff is great!"
0,Ian L.,Bijan,"Voted as best malay restaurant in KL, Bijan is an upscale restaurant serving local malay cuisine. The decor is a modern and classic without much aunthetic touch.
   Once you're here, you'll immediately know that it's an upscale place (afterall it's located at the expat-centric Bukit Ceylon). It's a handsome restaurant nonetheless. But in terms of offerings, you can probably find similar dishes from your neighborhood warung.
  At Bjian,  you get a more 'atas' version of local cuisine - from beer rendang, cucur udang to ikan masak asam pedas -  all the kampung dishes get an upgrade here. When it comes to taste, even though it might not be as authentic as your hook cook meal (read: mild), it's well-prepared and tastefully done.
   But Bijan is perhaps a better place for tourists and expats who are looking for a crash course of Malay cuisine."
0,Clinton L.,Bijan,Bijan is a delicious contemporary take on traditional malay food. Full of flavour. Fairly expensive though compared to what else you can get in the city.
0,Peng P.,Bijan,"Pretty decent restaurant with awesome food and a reasonable price, which is much affordable than the equivalent restaurants in Shanghai/Beijing.

The cuisines is a mixed Chinese-Malay style. I would recommend it to my Chinese friend. Actually, we have French and American in the same table last dinner. They all loved the food."
0,Mark M.,Bijan,"I went here about a week ago with my wife and brother while we were in town. We were recommended by the concierge at the Intercontinental and we were certainly not disappointed. This is a fine dining restaurant that serves Malaysian specialities for prices far below fine dining in the United States. We ordered a little bit of everything and the waiters were very polite and gracious in explaining what everything was on the menu. Also, their wine list is very cheap! Will definitely be back next time I am in KL."
0,Spencer K.,Bijan,"We found the food to be excellent. Probably the best meal we had in Malaysia. The service left something to be desired, with several forgotten orders, otherwise this would be a 5 star review. Would recommend."
0,Serina W.,Bijan,"I would rate this place more of a 4.5 if that were an option. It is hard to think of anything that they could really do better. We ordered the following dishes: a seabass fillets in a tumeric sauce wth tomatoes (Gulal lemak ikan siakap), freerange chicken in a sauce with chillies, tumeric, kaffir lime and coconut milk (Ayam Kampunh Limau Purit), oyster mushrooms with prawns in spicy curry (Masak Lemak Cendawan tiram dengan udang), a coconut rice to go with all the awesome sauces and for dessert, durian ice cream, corn creme brulee, sago in coconut milk and palm sugar syrup. Our 3 main dishes were really all different variations of curry, with the seabass being the spiciest. All 3 were delicious in their own ways and flavours that are just not available in North America where we're from. Finished the meal off with a white coffee - very aromatic. Service was great. There was a tropical rainstorm as we were leaving and it was nice that they had an employee outside with a big umbrella to help you to your cab with minimal soaking. All in all a great meal!"
0,Ash H.,Favola,"WAGYU RISOTTO!! Definitely one of the best risottos I've had in KL. Very nicely done, flavourful with just the right texture, and the wagyu slices complete the dish perfectly. A must-try for those risotto lovers.

A little more about the restaurant - it's a nice Venetian-styled fancy eatery located in the Le Meridien Hotel in KL Sentral. It isn't too crowded on week nights and usually quite full on the weekends so making a reservation is highly recommended. Their online reservations work well and you will get a follow up call within the day.

Food and wine selection is great, and so is the dessert. They have a dessert trio of three sample-sized signatures that is great for sharing. Price isn't too over the top either, with the Wagyu Risotto priced at RM70++, which is decent for the quality of food and dining experience. Great place for dates too."
0,Peter L.,Favola,"Favola is the Italian restaurant at the Le Meriden Hotel at KL Sentral, while the restaurant is a little out of the way, tucked deep inside the hotel on the 8th floor, it delivers some outstanding Italian food.  The chef, Domenico Piras, learned to cook in Sardinia, and has a fascinating career cooking everywhere from Michelin starred restaurants to the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.  I stopped by for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I selected a two-course express lunch and my starter was a beautifully presented salad topped with calamari rings.  The starter was fresh and flavorful and also filling.  The main course was a Sardinian pasta with a sauce that was cooked for 8 hours.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing, with melt in your mouth beef and some interesting spices. The bread selection is also very good, and served with 3 dips -  balsamic vinegar and olive oil, cheese, and mushroom.  I didn't get a dessert, but ended with espresso and biscotti which was perfect.  Service is friendly and helpful and the whole place brings everything together.  Definitely worth a try while in KL Sentral!"
0,Jacky L.,Favola,"It was amazing. The classic caprese salad was a nice light way to start off the meal. I liked that the bread plate came with different types of bread and also 3 options for dipping. The mains were consistently good. My favorite was the Maccheroni Puttanesca. The porcini mushroom was another highlight, the duck foie gras went well with the creaminess of the mushroom risotto. The homemade potato gnocchi was very filling and a bit creamy. It was a carbalicious delight, heavy for dinner but worth it."
0,Nadhira S.,Favola,"Amazing concept!

This place is smack on the 8th floor of Le Meridien Hotel, at KL Sentral and it seems everything there feels so Italian. It has such an Italian vibe. When you walk in you will see a big mural of faces of clowns, different versions of the sun and even a somewhat looking Versace logo. Ha ha! When you look up at the ceiling - it has roman words on it in the carvings, just like some of the museums, churches and cathedrals in Europe. The whole symbolism of the place also reminds me of Dan Browns 'Da Vinci Code' like the chequered floor and gaudy furnitures. SO Italian."
0,Jyn-Yann N.,Favola,"This is my favourite Italian restaurant. I just love their seafood risotto however if you eat too much of it, you will become sick of it. The decoration of the place is very nice and adorned. The food is amazing. Even the bread that they provide on the house tastes lovely. Unfortunately, the price is terrifyingly expensive. I would love to go again even though the money spent on that dinner would suddenly make my wallet a whole lot lighter."
0,Jeffrey Q.,Favola,Last night in KL. The restaurant is in the hotel. The food is really good. The pizza and pasta are delicious.
0,Jyn-Mun N.,Favola,"Favola is an authentic restaurant that serves Italian food that not only look very nice and appetising, but also taste very nice and appetising. The food includes pasta, seafood, pizza and others and they have one of the best selection of Italian wines. The cost is pricey, but it's normal for an authentic Italian restaurant in a hotel."
0,Huan C.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Can you taste and experience the difference?

I ordered half of a duck as it appears to be a popular food option based on past reviews. This is a popular restaurants among local. Just a heads up to foreigners, they don't have a menu, but they did have a young waitress who spoke English. If you are able to speak a regional language, you just name what dish you want prepared.

My duck was a bit of an eye opener. I am very custom to having fatty duck that having lean ducks was a breath of fresh air. The duck along with the sauce was delicious. It was simple but yet the meal was more meaningful I have previously encountered. The meal provided a new sense of appreciation regarding meal and food consumption.  

Since they didn't have a menu, I didn't quite know the price. I paid approximately 39 malaysian ringgit (close to $9.50)."
0,Guy F.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Came here for first time with local friend.  HSD the roast duck, pork soup with figs, egg with shark fin and crab, kang kong, and ended with pancake with lotus paste filling.   All the dishes were very flavorful, also had some shell in my crabmeat egg.  Roast duck was not fatty which was nice.  The soup had nice pork flavor and the fig was pleasant sweetness.  Servers were nice too.  No prices on menu, but our bill was fair and reasonable, so trust them.  The lotus paste filled pancake was nice way to end our dinner."
0,Amalie E.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"The best authentic food experience ever in a long time.
I often get emotionally touched by things, but rarely by food. This dinner reminded me about my childhood,  my grandma,  home,  family & traditions,  I almost cried (def my heart) The sweetes hostes - an elderly grandma, caring for me & looking after I have what I need. Just amazing!"
0,Adelynn T.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"One of the oldest and traditional restaurants in KL/Pudu. This place was opened many many years ago and has 2 sides of the restaurant. One is the old side (without aircond) and the other side has aircond. This place is run by a family. That's why mostly the employees are old or mixed up.

What's good here? Well, i normally go with the pei pa duck which is crispy and awesome! The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. DELICIOUS!

Vegetables - You can just ask them what vegetable that they have for the day..and you pick your choice and the style of cooking (with belacan or just normal plain garlic style).

Sometimes, we will have the sang choi pow..which is fried egg + crab meat + some glass noodles..you wrap it with raw vege (iceberg lettuce leaves) it's sorta the salad in asian way.

During Chinese New Year, you can have the traditional yee sang...which is raw fish slices with strips of ginger in the yee sang. That's the olden version of yee sang in a more wealthy way. Or you can always order the jellyfish version.

If you want to have a dinner here during Chinese New Year, a more customised way, you can book a table here and order the dishes first. Of course, a deposit would be needed (Just in case if you don't appear)...There are all sorts of dishes and they will recommend to you too!

Overall experience : 5/5 (One of my fav place to makan)
Price Rating : 4/5 (Affordable according to my family since it's good chinese food)"
0,Lisa W.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"One of my faves. Hands. Friggin. Down.

My family has been going here for literally generations. This place be hella old.

I'm gonna be completely not-politically correct and suggest you get the sharks fin egg lettuce wraps. Yes. Good Lord.

Another thing that sends the cherubim of heaven into sweet, melodic, song is the poached chicken with ginger sauce. Dat sauce.

Also, the Pat Poh Ngap is one of the best I've ever tasted. Though, that said, it's a little difficult to compare with other places because I've pretty much only had it here and one other place.

Go. You'll discover the meaning of true love."
0,Alan's O.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,Taste the great authentic cuisine of malaysian chinese. Recommended food- duck - crab meat ball - dao si fish
0,Wye Mun K.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"This restaurant has been here since my grandparents were born, the iconic old fashioned Chinese Restaurant, Sek Yuen. They're famous for a couple of dishes such as their King Pork Ribs. The cooks here are really old uncles that look like grandfathers, which you can say are well experienced enough with their food.

It's rather run down, but the food here is just great. They cook their food not using gas but using wood instead so you get the real ""wok hei"" when you eat here. Apparently cooking with wood gives your food a better taste. You can also order their Fermented Bean Paste Fish which is really good. I've been eating here since I was a kid so I definitely recommend trying this place actually closes."
0,Annabelle Y.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Comforting fare cooked by elderly chefs in a restaurant filled with nostalgia and history, that's what Sek Yuen is all about. They certainly know their Cantonese cuisine as every dish is cooked with love and just the right touch of saltiness. The walls, decked with black and white photographs depict the years they have toiled to achieve the top-notch status that they currently hold. So onwards with the food! Start off with the cold appetizer dish that comes in a huge plate (Lang poon) filled with various morsels of delight from mushrooms, boiled jellyfish,  sesame infused meats and seafood. The perfect way to cleanse one's palate before the torrid of dishes begin. The roast duck was just perfectly thin and crispy, the way it should be done while the braised lamb dish was hearty fare and sauce amazing doused over the fluffy white rice. We also ordered 2 different greens to balance out the meal. They of course came well fried and still crunchy. Overall, don't expect fine dining, but do expect to walk out with a very full stomach"
0,Rick B.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,What I am looking for- great food and right atmosphere. Awesome place to blend in with the locals.
0,Shan K.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,"Went here with the fam for CNY eve lunch. Heard a lot about this restaurant being the oldest Chinese restaurant in KL...plus, they use wood-ovens to cook the food. SOO I was pretty excited to try it.

The menu was pre-selected and booked by my aunt, so we didn't actually have much of a choice. Of course, we started with yee sang - which was delicious! Great taste but no salmon. Regardless, it was the tastiest yee sang I had all CNY. Then we had the four seasons dish (basically a seafood platter) which was also pretty good. Next came sauteed chives with roasted pork belly - noms! Great dish - generous on the pork. Then, we had fried yam topped with cashew nuts, diced chicken, onions and bell peppers. Small portion but delicious. I wasn't too impressed with the Chinese mushroom dish which came next - average. Pork ribs were awesome. Chunky, meaty, perfectly done. Steamed fish was also average but fresh. Last but not least came the duck. This famous duck that everyone was raving about was definitely too hyped up. The skin was amazing but there was barely any meat and the meat was tough. I've had better duck.

Ambience wise, it's your typical chinese coffee shop...super casual and loud..holes in the tablecloths etc. But I think it adds to the ""old"" feel. We sat at the outside part of the restaurant since the ACed side was full. Despite being outside, they had a lot of fans and good ventilation.

I'd be excited to come back and order some of their other dishes. A great first experience."
0,Kent T.,Sek Yuen Restaurant,Try the crisp duck and salted fish steam with minced pork. Authentic cooking. A cuisine way back to memory lane!
0,JD H.,Alor Food Corner,"I am placing this review under this particular corner listing but it really represents an entire food area in the heart of the action in KL. This is my first time in Malaysia and the food scene is impressive. At the corner of Jalan Alor and Changkat Bukit Bintang starts the long Eat Street that extends all the way down Jalan Alor. For any seriously adventurous foodies, come here for a foodgasm. There is a shop at the corner open 24 hours for those of you jet-lagged like me that need something to do at 3 am and the rest of the street is pretty much shutting down by 4 am but this entire area really doesn't get going until after dark and into the wee hours of the morning.

There are food shops lining the street and in front of many of them are street vendor carts. The whole place smells like Durian which can be either good or off-putting depending on if you like that smell and all of the areas to sit and eat are outdoors so there is no escaping it. Also, the heat can be oppressive but once the sun goes down, the temperature gets noticeably cooler.

Walking up and down Jalan Alor I saw places that sell Indian food, Malaysian food, Thai food, Chinese food, North Vietnamese food, South Vietnamese food, Hong Kong Dim Sum, Fruit carts, Smoothie carts, Coconut carts, Ice Cream carts, Vegetarian spots, Halal spots, and on and on it goes. You get the picture. The people watching was pretty incredible in the early evening too and it is so packed that you better like pressing flesh in a hot, sticky environment with strangers.

I was so overwhelmed by the choices, the foreign languages, the signs I could not read, and the vendors yelling hawker talk to me that I could not decide what to eat and frankly didn't recognize half of the stuff they had. I finally just sat at an empty table and one of the vendors looked at me when I sat down and grunted what I believe was a greeting in my general direction. She looked at me expecting me to order or do something and I had no idea what I was doing or what she even had on offer so I did the next best thing to faking a seizure in an emergency awkward situation...I put on my lost tourist face and said, ""Please just feed me"" which she did by wok frying up a plate of fresh noodle with shrimp, chicken and crunchy fatty pork bits with a sauce made from dark soy. For $10 Ringgits (about $2.35 USD), it was the right call. Savory and deeply smoky from the wok, it totally satisfied.

I'm planning to go back to the area again tonight, sit somewhere else, and try the lost tourist approach again to see what I get. Kind of like rolling the dice in Vegas with your food options. This entire area is amazing if you like local culture, local food, and aren't afraid to feel out of your element. This is a special place, along the lines of a Singaporean hawker center or an open air wet market in Vietnam. If you are in the area, don't miss it."
0,Ray Chen C.,Alor Food Corner,"We went there because of all the lengthy good reviews.
However, it turned out to be a bit disappointing.

We waited 45mins at least to get dished served, small portion and not that cheap in terms of the food amount inside the dishes.  But the taste is ok, not super good but ok.

It is at the head of a extremely busy food street, so would suggest to try out some others instead of having the same not so impressed meal again."
0,Adam G.,Alor Food Corner,"If you're in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia...you MUST visit this cool spot.  The food stands at this corner are all extremely good!!!  Man, I feel that everyone will love the food as much I did...what an awesome experience I had at this corner.  Loved it!!!  :)"
0,Fatma H.,Alor Food Corner,"Very good place, it s local, basic (including the service) but nice people and delicious food. You really need to try it even if the place is not that fancy."
0,Nicole S.,Food Republic,"Food Republic is a food court located in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur. I frequent this food court and have tried pretty much everything. My favorite stall would be the thai food as they make very food phad thai and tom yam mee hoon. There is a soya stall and youtiou too. The curry rice here however is very expensive and not worth it. A plate of rice, one vege and 2 meats can come up to RM15 which i think is just ridiculous for mix rice that you can get for a fraction of the price at chinese shops.

The food court is always packed regardless what time it is. Morning, noon and night you would have trouble looking for a table but I think its just cause everything here is just so yummy and there's a good selection of different types of food too."
0,Nora F.,Food Republic,"Pavilion offers many food places for those hungry people. Food republic is located downstairs. It's like a food court where people find different types of food from different corners and stands. I walked around to see what I feel like eating, hmmm. I was very confused looking at what they had to offer. A lot of food to feed my need. Finally I ended up at Nasi Padang section and ordered that. I had rice with fish, chicken and okra. Wow! The fish was very good! This took-too-long-to-order dish really paid off! I had a lot of questions prior to my order, pardon me! My sister had spicy fish filet from Little Wok and that was awesome! This one came in a big metal bowl along with tasty vegetable. Her friend had beef pepper rice. I tried everything and we had a winner! Me! Because I had the pleasure to try them all!"
0,Jon C.,Food Republic,"This food court in particular has several different options that are international brands.

There is coco curry house and pepper steak. I saw Thai options. There is a dim sum option (not very good).

Overall a good variety of food, affordable but not the cheapest/tastiest food. I'd say if you're looking for Malaysian food, you'll probably find Christ/tastier food elsewhere, but they have the options to fill the void."
0,Juan S.,Food Republic,"Great food court. From food stalls to restaurants. Big lunch crowd at lunch and weekends. Toast Box is my favorite place to get local Malaysian Kopi. Takes a while to try all the food here. Nasi padang, Thai, Korean, Ramen, wontons, tepanyaki and more.  Big kudos for the support staff that cleans the tables. Super efficient in getting table cleaned. Great place to get a bite to eat after walking the mall."
0,Rory B.,Food Republic,"So many different options in one place!  The hardest part is picking which one to try, but it's great for groups since everyone can pick there own cuisine.

Food is really good and pretty inexpensive.  Although I like the really ""authentic"" experiences like Jalan Alor or Hutong for the ambience, this is still a great and easy option, especially if some people prefer the ""cleaner"" indoor food court."
0,Brenda L.,Food Republic,"The best food court I have ever seen! The options are endless. I tried my 1st ever nasi lemak here @ a spot called (surprise?) Nasi Lemak. The dish was huge and under $4 US dollars and was super filling. It came with chicken, a side of salty fish, coconut rice, cucumber and shrimp chips. Aside from that, there are dessert spots like a cheesecake store, Beard Papa (where you can get durian cream puffs), Eggette (the wait here is long-beware). My friends had hot pot and ramen here & they all thought it was great. It's really hard to decide what kind of food you want because they have so many great and appetizing options. I really wish this food court existed in Denver or San Jose."
0,Kevin W.,Food Republic,"If you want to be spoiled for choices, you are at the right place, Food Republic, is a massive food court in Pavilion KL there has many types of food to choose from.
Name it from local cuisine to, Hong Kong style, Taiwan style, Thai, Indonesian, Western, Italian, Japanase, whatever it is, you can find it at Food Republic.

I do like the nasi lemak from the nasi lemak stall at Food Republic. I really like their sambal. Sambal is one of the most important ingredient in nasi lemak that must be right, if not all will fail.

I tend to have a hard time choosing what I want to eat while at the food court because I want to eat everything! Also during lunch and dinner time, this place is usually packed and getting a table may be difficult. So plan your time properly to avoid such hassle."
0,Ian L.,Food Republic,"Originated from Singapore, Food Republic has been one of my favorite places to go when I visit Singapore. The open format here in Pavilion follows very much like its sister company.
   However, almost every time I am here I go to the tepanyaki store. The delicious tepanyaki grilled by chefs on the spot guarantees the freshness of food. A set meal only cost you RM15.90 with a choice of meat, soup, rice and two types of vegetables! Definitely worth the money.
   The char kuay teow store was a serious disappointment. Not only the portion is small, it's way too oily to our liking. Claiming it as 'Penang' char kuay teow might even be false advertising. Also, the juice counter is somewhere you want to avoid. A cup of juice will set you back around RM6 with only a few mouthful (they added a lot of ice).
   Even though is not perfect, Food Republic is still a cheaper choice in Pavilion."
0,Derrick V.,Food Republic,"Excellent food court in Pavilion mall. There's a chicken rice spot that was sadly, way better than the ones I tried in Singapore. Sergeant chicken rice is the name I think, but just look for the hanging steamed and roasted chickens. Really flavorful chicken and rice. As you can tell, I tried this dish a lot on this trip haha"
0,Shan K.,Food Republic,"Good selection here - not just Malaysian food. Prices are decent but a little more on the pricier food court side (depending on the stall). I think it's pretty obvious, but try to avoid lunch hours (11:30am - 1:30pm) as it gets super packed/hard to find a table. The cooks tend to be more rushed during that time and thus, the food not as well prepared/portions not as generous.

Wish they had more options for drinks though. Mostly the standard syrupy drinks and some fresh juices. If you're looking for awesome Malaysian food, I'd recommend going to Hutong (Lot 10 food court) instead. So much amazing food down there and just a 2 min walk from Pavilion."
0,Vanessa W.,Food Republic,"Usually if I go Pavillion I will surely go to their food court to eat . The food court have a lot of food to choose . I remember trying the korean food ,chiken rice and spaghetti over there . The one that I love the most is the spaghetti and macaroons !  The portion ofthe food is quite big and it is not really expensive . It only cost about RM15 to RM 20 per plate . I like the one with carbonara sauce and some bacon on it . While my mother likes their spaghetti with olive oils. It is called as seafood spaghetti if I am not wrong. The food court will be quite crowded especially during the peak hour . It is a self service food court so we need to take the fork and spoon by ourselves and ofcourse we must collect the food ourselves ."
0,Diviyah G.,Food Republic,"Food Republic is a food court in Pavilion that offers a WIDE range of food to choose from. I love this food court mainly because of their variety. The cuisines range from Thai to Malaysia to Western to Japanese to even Hong Kong. It's one place where you can find many different delicacies from different countries. This food court is very clean and crowded all the time, especially on weekends. If you're going during peak hours, make sure to get there early to find a place first before getting your food.

The food is fairly good but I feel that it is a little bit on the expensive side for a food court. The price I pay for a bowl of Yong Tau Foo dish here is what I would pay for 2 bowls elsewhere. Overall, if you're looking for variety, this is the place. I go here when I cant decide which restaurant to go to as this gives me many options to choose from. Do give it a try!"
0,Ryan Q.,Food Republic,"Located in Pavillion, there are many variations of cuisines in stored for the public. From Teppanyaki, Western, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Indian Stalls, to typical Chinese food, Vegetarian stalls and many more.

To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetarian dishes  here. Found it kinda greasy and rather than taking the dishes yourself, the people there are the ones placing it on your place. The helpings are kinda small too.

Prices here are quite high. I paid RM 15 for my meal and to be frank, for typical Chinese Vegetarian food, you'd expect it to be cheaper. Probably it's because of the exorbitant rentals here. I also think people come here because of the convenience during lunch hours. Nonetheless, you're better off at other restaurants in this mall."
0,Jay O.,Food Republic,"Food republic are one of the prominent and well-known food court in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Even tourist are familiar about their existence. But those of you who not now, I feel very sorry for you, open your computer and search google. I am kidding, please don't take it seriously. Haha (sorry for the teasing)

Food republic is a food court that has remarkable variety of food stall that consists Korean, Japanese, Taiwan, Indonesian, Thai, Local and multitudinous more. Well, as for a local boy that grew up here in Kuala Lumpur. I would definitely their food stall especially Hot Plate , Korean food and Local food. It's DAMN good!! I mean if you don't mind food court, this are the food stall that you should visit!!! However, food republic are extremely wide and crowded.  You might faint just by observing the loads of people walking around food republic.If you worry about their food quality or cleanliness? Don't worry. They are pretty good!!! but don't try their Yong tau fu stall -Expensive and taste dreadful. Besides, if you ever need some drinks. They have a specific stall that only sells beverages, either beverages that are jam packed with ice or hot. Price range are from RM 8 to RM 25. Depending on your food.

Overall, I am satisfied with their food and I could assured you their food are pretty amazing. Some of them are might be better than other ""high-class"" restaurant, seriously. No kidding!"
0,Wye Mun K.,Hakka Restaurant,"One of the oldest restaurants in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. It's located opposite Pavilion. Hakka Restaurant has been around for god knows how long and they have been packed ever since they opened. They've renovated their restaurant and it looks a lot bigger and nicer compared to before.

They serve Hakka dishes here and Chinese dishes here. But what I love about this place is that, they even have steamboat!! The steamboat here is really good too I must say. I always come here for steamboat with my family. You can order sides for your steamboat such as pork slice, pork liver and many other fresh poultry as well. They're always full so make sure you make a reservation or head over early to get ahead of the crowd!"
0,Jay C.,Hakka Restaurant,"The location is literally surrounded by buildings. A one big flat opening in the middle of highrise buildings.
The food is great. Is a fusion of Chinese Malay style. Must try the lettuce wrapped sauteed pork, pork with bun and crab meat in its shell.
The day I went there was Carlsberg beer girls doing the beer promotion I guess because, as soon as I empty my cup there was the girls pouring it. Something I don't get to experience in US.
It really gets packed so, expect to wait 10~20 minutes if you come during dinner time."
0,Clarence J.,Hakka Restaurant,"(This is probably more like 2.5 stars to me, but I'm rounding up because of the potential here.)  I was underwhelmed by the food on my first visit, but I do plan to try again as the environment is great, the prices are good, and many things on the menu looked good so perhaps I just chose poorly.

If the environment was rated separately, I'd give it four stars easily.  There's an indoor section, but the larger dining space is a huge open-air 'hall' under an excellent retractable roof that is opened in great weather.  Bamboo shades can be lowered from the sides in the case of rain, and numerous ceiling and side fans keep the air moving.  (You'll still be warm on a hot day of course, but it's not too bad.)  The white tablecloths over the tables contrast nicely with the lively lime green of the plastic chairs.  There are tables of numerous sizes, each of the larger ones with a turntable in the middle to ease sharing of food.

In regard to the food, while the menu is extensive and has numerous excellent-looking things, what I tried was unbalanced.  The salt-and-pepper prawns were beautifully cooked but I found them to be overly salty.  Meanwhile, the grilled ostrich was rubbery and didn't have much flavor [and I have had ostrich many times and usually thoroughly enjoy it], although the ginger, onions, peppers, and sauce for the dish were all wonderful.

The staff was efficient.  Some of the people I interacted with engaged with a smile, while others were brusque.  Everything for us was taken care of fine, but there did seem to be a bit of confusion or overlap among the waitstaff as numerous people came by to check the ticket on our table during our meal (which I assume was to make sure we had everything we had ordered) and several others asked if we wanted to order more drinks, sometimes right on the heels of the previous person who had asked."
0,Gary A.,Hakka Restaurant,"My local friends in KL and I eat here once or twice a month. This place is a KL icon- I think they've been operating for 60 years or so.  The menu is great and they're very flexible for a vegan like me.  Great great great Chinese food.  Love me some sautéed sweet potato greens!

The atmosphere is truly outdoor family picnic style.  If you're lucky it will start to rain and the auto-roof will extend and shield you.  Come casual- life is good!

Great desserts, noodles, tofu a million different ways, and plenty for omnivores, too.

Service is eh, but they get the job done."
0,Vanessa O.,Hakka Restaurant,"This is a famous Chinese restaurant that has been there perhaps since when I was little girl. One night after work, my colleagues were craving for their famous deep fried pork leg. I wasn't a fan but I tagged along just to catch up with my colleagues and have fun.

It was a pity that my phone was low batt and I didn't have a power bank with me, hence no pictures of the food that we ordered - maybe next round. Anyway, we were seated in the air-conditioned room and within seconds, the waiter came over to place orders for us. Although that place was packed - I was pleasantly surprised for their prompt service. Only later I realised that each waiter/waitresses were designated to a few tables under their service. How neat!

Price range was between RM18 above and man, I remembered that the famous deep fried pork leg cost RM50++ for a small serving. I wasn't keen to try my next round perhaps it is because I simply don't find it delicious - again, I'm not a fan of pork. But don't get me wrong, it is very crispy outside and tender meat inside.

Other dishes were ordinary and overall, I did enjoy myself very much. So if you are a pork lover, give it a go!"
0,Shev R.,Hakka Restaurant,"Amazing food. Very authentic Malaysian. I would def recommend. Fried rice, spicy shrimp and crispy chicken."
0,Su Zanne C.,Hakka Restaurant,"Placed right  behind of Pavilion Shopping Mall, Hakka Restaurant is a family conducive Chinese restaurant that is half indoors and half in the open air, made possible with a convertible rooftop. On a good dry night, you could be dining under the stars with a great view of Pavilion, and on a rainy night, you will be kept safe from getting drench. The semi-outdoor experience is a nice change. Having some fresh air while you dine is one of the best feelings other than being among family members.

Among all the different types of dishes that we have ordered, it was the famous Hakka Kau Yoke (steamed pork bellies) with preserved vegetables that stood out. The pork was tender with a good amount of fats for those who love eating the fats, and the preserved vegetables are pickled well with a tinge of saltiness. Best to eat this dish with rice to balance everything out."
0,Rebecca W.,Hakka Restaurant,"My family has been wanting to have some Hakka cuisine for the longest time, so we finally embrace the KL traffic and went to Hakka Restaurant. The restaurant is located opposite of Pavilion.

Whenever we dine at a Hakka restaurant, we would definitely order Yam Abacus Seed. The Abacus Seed in Hakka Restaurant was really good, nice texture with a pleasant yam flavours. The Crispy Duck was pretty good too - nice crispy skin with tender meat. On the other hand, the Pig Intestines with Pineapple was slightly disappointing. The texture of the intestines was good, but the pineapple was slightly over-powering.

Overall, the food was good and I heard the German Pork Knuckle was delicious. Sadly, we did not order this that night, but will mostly give this a try during our next visit."
0,Stephen L.,Hakka Restaurant,Great traditional Chinese restaurant. It is a Hakka restaurant. It is of the dialect of Chinese people who are guest in the past. This is my favorite restaurant that I take my oversea guest to try the authentic Chinese food.
0,Louise A.,Skillet @ 163,"I know you all think this place is to expensive but really, its not! If you eat there you will give them all the money you have left ;) this was crazy good. And not in a regular way, this was an experiance! First of all it was clean and stylish. Second of all they spoke great english and that actually means alot when you just been in vietnam where you have to do gestures and everything. They gave great service and they had 3 extra dishes for free when you already ordered 3. They had set menues for around 130RM, thats what we took. So first we got an apetizer and newly baked bread then we got our starters, I had a lobster cappuccino  really good and with a bit of a heat in it and coriander. My man got fois gras and it was beautiful. Lovely. For main I had lamb with so many flavours in a perfect mix and balance. My man got this crabpasta with tigerprawns. Crispy and delicious! Had some huge fisheggs on it, tasted so good, they usualy dont have any really taste but theese were smoky and fishy so for desert whish was the best part, I had an apricot sorbet thing with rochefort. It was amazing, very interesting tastings but so nice!!
And my man had this chocolate sticky pudding with a caramel sause and vanilla icecream, we both could die for that one! I didnt want it to end. It was just amazingly good!
After that they gave us some chocolate bites, and their coffee was also according to my man fab.
The backgroundmusic was good, not to lound but there. Its just around the corner from the twintowers, like 4 minute walk. The waiters were very kind and knowledged, its a must in kuala lumpur."
0,Alma P.,Skillet @ 163,"Seriously good food here folks... this was one of the BEST meals I had on this trip to Asia. At least as good, if not better than the two and three star michelins we dined at in Singapore.

We opted to do the prix-fixe menu for two and were impressed with every dish that came out. Everything we cooked perfectly with amazing flavor combinations. The menu changes seasonally so I am reticent to list our menu but my favorite dish was the pan seared five spice duck breast. It was DIVINE and if it's on the menu when you go I HIGHLY recommend you try it.

The service was also stellar here - very attentive and helpful. I love that the chef also came out to interact with the patrons. I didn't see this anywhere else in Asia so I was impressed that the took the time.

With the exchange for US vs Malaysian dollars so favorable to us I almost felt like we got away with murder for this meal....delicious murder. ;)"
0,Paige K.,Skillet @ 163,"The food was very good and creative. One course was a little heavy too cheesy, but everything else had a nice balance and fun element to it.
Dessert was definitely my favorite
The staff were very friendly and informative. Chele my waitress was so nice."
0,K W.,Skillet @ 163,"I've been somewhat disappointed with most of the dining in KL. Perhaps I'm getting picky in my old age, but honestly, My gut tells me the food scene here is a bit overhyped.

On our last day we were looking for some place convenient to our hotel, Fraser Place, and found we didn't even have to leave the building to grab lunch.

We both ordered a soup and salad. Followed by a shared dish of their carbonara pasta.

In a word... WOW!

The tomato soup was one of the best I've had... ever. That's saying quite a bit for a New Yorker of Italian descent. It was clearly made with fresh tomatoes and was expertly finished with just the right amount of basil. It wasn't overly sweetened the way most tomato soups can be and was the perfect texture for a hot KL day, not too thick but not too watery either.

The salads were fantastic. We ordered the crab and avocado along side the duck confit salad. Both were crisp, refreshing and hit the spot after a hot bowl of soup.

The pasta dish was wonderfully rich, perfectly al dente, with an awesome blend of melted cheeses, spices and beef bacon. Coming from America, we go in for the whole hog when it comes to bacon, so this was a first for me. I was thoroughly impressed. I couldn't believe how spot-on the hickory smoke flavor was in the shredded strips of fatty beef. Had I not paid attention to the fact that pork was overtly replaced with something clever in virtually every option on the menu, I would have been completely fooled. The shaved parmesan flake on top of each dish provided the added saltiness this plate would have been missing otherwise. All in, it was a fantastic blend of flavors with the right separation of bacon and parmesan as contrasting layers that really made this dish sing. Half a plate was the perfect helping after a couple of starters. If you're looking to crawl into bed and nap afterwards have an entire bowl to yourself. It will be a well spent evening.

The service was incredibly friendly, and the chef went out of his way to plate the pasta in separate bowls for us when he saw on the ticket that we had only ordered one main between the two of us. Shows that they're paying attention to the details.

I couldn't find something negative to say about this place if I tried. They seem to have a well disciplined staff that isn't too stuck up or snooty. The menu is superb. It manages to pull off subtle creativity while still delivering on preconceived expectations of what the same dish may have tasted like had mom cooked it back home (wherever that may be). The vibe is smart but relaxed. The open concept and friendly attitude is contagious. Don't be surprised if you find yourself making friends with the guests that are seated right next to you.

If you get the chance, stop in. You'll be glad you did. Kudos to the team behind this place. A true oasis in a city of overwhelming options."
0,Jerry C.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Tapas were on our minds and we decided to skip the mall chain restaurants. Pinchos was pretty highly rated so we made a reservation and dashed over. The place was packed with ex-pats. Outside tables, bar, front and back mezzanine dining rooms. Luckily our table in back was ready.

Along with a bottle of Pedra da Auga Albariño 2012 Spanish wine, three of us ordered 9 dishes! There were probably 30+ tapas to select from. Every dish was top notch delicious. We could not go wrong.

My favorite was a special: Fresh Octopus leg, pulpo, flown in from Spain and grilled. It was perfectly cooked and not chewy. Octopus not chewy? That's a first for me. It was divine!

Service was cordial and friendly. Dishes came out quickly and all at once. Our table couldn't fit any more food, and neither could our stomachs.

Pinchos was our favorite meal in Kuala Lumpur. I recommended Pinchos to friends on their way to KL, and they loved it too!"
0,Eddie R.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"We found this spot near our hotel. With a Street that's full of restaurants we wanted something light and quick and this place hit the spot. They have a huge selection of wines from all over the world including sangria. They also have several cocktails and a few beers. We had a tortilla Espanola which is pretty good not very authentic but it did it's job served with aioli. The shrimp in garlic was amazing and they brought it out with bread to soak up all the juices and garlic. We also ordered toasted bread with tomato garlic and olive oil, also a win. The restaurant was very chic and well decorated. The staff was friendly and we had an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend the spot for some shared tapas between friends or a couple."
0,Damian W.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Food: 3.5/5.0
Service: 3.5/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0

Solid tapas spot in a central location, but nobody is going to mistake this for Spanish food.  Sampled half the menu plus the rabbit/seafood paella.  Everything was good but nothing struck as being noteworthy.  The paella felt a little better than the tapas."
0,Brandon H.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Was one of three spots I tried while in Changkat Bukit Bintang (Kuala Lumpur). Stopped in for a quick bite and drinks and was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a good mix of tapas and drinks. Managed to try the Patatas Bravas, Sauteed prawns with chili and olive oil and the Meatballs with Bread + Marinara. Portions were a good a size and the drink menu was pretty vast. Food and drink prices are also decent, but could easily tilt towards the expensive end."
0,Michelle B.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Stopped in last night. It appeared most people were there for the drinks. I had Spanish style fried potatoes and fried calamari.  Was not very impressed but it could of just been what ordered. I also had a glass of sangria which was bottled, not made fresh

So I was not impressed by the food nor drink. This was my first night out in KL and I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews."
0,Ian L.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Popular amongst expats and locals alike, in a short span of two years, Pinchos has become somewhat a staple dive bar along Changkat.
   It's a great place for pre-drinks and some tapas before hitting the club. But if you're going to stay, the wines are pretty decent too. Bookings are advisable on weekends."
0,Diana C.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"This is my ultimate favorite restaurant in KL.

I wasn't a big fan of Tapas places until I went to Pincho's. Located in Changkat, it is easy to miss it if you don't have someone who knows the area. There are so many places around that are louder and more appealing. You will have missed out if you don't go.  

Pincho's is a spanish themed place that has the most amazing selection of tapas you can possibly imagine! Some of my (many) favorites are the Beef Skewer with mushrooms, the meat balls and the mushrooms. If you are a fan of prosciutto, you are going to love their Jamon Serrano. They make great sangria and also offer a great selection of wines, beers and whiskeys.

The service is really good, and they offer seating options inside and outside. The place is not too big, so make sure you make reservations if you intend to go with a large group of friends (which is recommendable, since you can order a variety of tapas to share, and everyone gets to taste a bit of everything).

The price is a bit expensive, but totally worth it."
0,Marija S.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Mmmmm Spanish food, Spanish music and Spanish wine..

It almost felt like I was back to Europe for an evening! :)

Guess what dish do you have to try there, once you go? :)
Haha yes TAPAS!

Tasty delicious food, so refreshing! I think in this area it is definitely the highest quality meal you can get!

I would say, be prepared to pay the price, but oh wow it is definitely worth it!

Yummyyy I just wanna go back there right now !

It is my very favourite restaurant In chang kat!

ENJOY!"
0,William D.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"If I had to pick one place as my favorite spot for eating and drinking in KL it would be Pinchos.  Pinchos is the only place that delivers awesomeness every time in every category.  

The tapas here are excellent.  The Serrano ham on toast is to die for.  The roasted mild peppers are fantastic.  The bacon wrapped dates will blow your mind.  

The drinks are worth the money. A gun and tonic is RM32 but you can chose from different gins and specialty tonics. Just ask one of the very knowledgeable bar tenders for help.

My favorite thing about Pinchos is the service. It is so hard to find friendly, intelligent, helpful and attentive service in KL and Pinchos is great every time.  The owners are almost always there making sure everything is running smoothly.  The staff all speak English well and can handle most any dinning issues."
0,Theresa H.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Loved everything about this restaurant. The food, the staff, the decor, the service, the Sangrias, the mixologists. Did I mention the food. Everything was amazing. So crowded on Valentine's it looks like this is a top pick for a lot of people. Which is a very good sign, since there is A LOT of competition in this part of town."
0,Sara M.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"This place just serves the very best food ever! I don't know if I was just hungry but the food was so delicious, my friends and I were heading back from an Orchestra show that night and some friends knew this place and promised us that it's the very best! I joined along and we made this family order where we shared everything and it was heavenly!!

You definitely must try the Gambas al Ajillo which has prawns with garlic and chili and chorizo Con Setas, it has sausage with mushrooms.

The service was good! the staff are happy to help! the seating on the other hand is not the most comfortable and it's quite crowded but if you are engaged in a good conversation then you wouldn't notice!! :)"
0,Emila O.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Good food. Great portions, we had five different Tapas and it was enough for two. Shrimp with chili, mushrooms, bread with tomato(not so exciting), beef and calamari."
0,Bryan S.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,"Here's a tip. If you ever decide to visit Pinchos, you'd do well to make a reservation earlier in the day as this place has a tendency to fill up very quickly, which one can only take as a good sign. Run by a husband and wife team, Pinchos specializes in Spanish style tapas and while it is definitely on the pricier side, the quality of the food is vindication enough. The spicy chorizo with chunky cubes of potatoes in pure comfort food. Also lookout for the sautéed mushrooms with herbs and the garlicky shrimp tapas. Paella is served here as well and it's the perfect hearty, soulful accompaniment to all the little plates of joy you'll be getting. So yeah, it's not something I'd afford myself on a regular basis, but it's a good place to check out if you're in the mood to spoil yourself and indulge in a really good meal. Or impress your date.  Assuming you have one."
0,Matt D.,Pinchos Tapas Bar,Great food and atmosphere. Wonderful staff. A little expensive but competitive with other up-scale restaurants in Bukit Bintang.
0,Shiao Wenn C.,Onde Onde,"If you're looking for authentic Malaysian food, this is the place for it! The food is amazing, great portion at a reasonable price! The kopi santan is a must try!!"
0,Kris A.,Onde Onde,We happen to walk by by this restaurant after our dinner. The service staff was so friendly that we decided to try their dessert. Excellently done chendol! The taste of Gula Melaka is so tasty and fragrant and the touch of coconut milk is just of the right amount not over powering. So delicious we are going back for their main course!
0,Yeoh J.,Koryo-Won,Good food and nice environment. A bit pricey but this is expected out from this type of premises. Will come back again.
0,Kiran S.,Koryo-Won,"Good location in the basement of the Starhill mall at the JW Marriott in KL-across Bukit Bintang from the Pavilion mall. Good ambience, very welcoming staff. Service and food were superb!  Generous portions; waiter even dissuaded is from over-ordering.Waiter barbecues for you and serves individual meat servings . Classic Korean bbq, superbly done, very delicious! Price is reasonable given quality, a monumental meal for 3 of us, including Soju, cost a total of RM 460.  Kudos to management and staff for running a high class show."
0,Amirul R.,Koryo-Won,"When you're at a Starhill establishment, you expect great food and great service (for a matching lofty price, though.) Koryo-Won is one of my family's favorites. I have never been disappointed by them. The various types of kalbi barbecue here are all fantastic, and the staff are incredibly attentive as they help you cook the food, making sure to keep your side dishes constantly refilled as long as you want. If there's another, better Korean BBQ that also happens to have this sort of high quality ambiance, I don't know it. (Feel free to tell me.)"
0,James L.,The Orchid Conservatory,"Words alone cannot explain how beautiful this place is. It has a hanging garden and orchid scape within a glass atrium located inside Majestic Hotel. I have to say this is the only one of its kind in the country. The orchids on display is heaven for the flower lovers. They are extremely well taken care of with stunning large-petaled blooms. They do change the variety of orchids on display as the seasons progress.

As you can see it's a glass atrium that is very private for your afternoon tea and intimate lunches. You may also book this for private celebratory dinners for up to 15 persons. Do bare in mind that this will not cost less than RM3000 in total."
0,Harvey T.,The Orchid Conservatory,"The Orchid Conservatory at Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur is a very beautiful indoor garden with the sun shining through the glass atrium. This is the best place where you can have your afternoon tea, mini gathering, birthday party or celebrating baby shower here with colorful orchid blooming all over the wall and tables.

The afternoon tea here is similar with what you'll have in the Colonial Cafe and Drawing room, it's just different themes. It's includes hot savories, sandwiches, sweet desserts and scones. However, the price of the afternoon tea having at Orchid Conservatory is more expensive, which is about RM88++ (before GST) per pax. It's start from 3 p.m to 6.30 p.m daily. Due to high demand as it's only fit maximum of 20 person in the room. I will suggest you to do a reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. I haven't get the chance to have the Hi-Tea in Orchid Conservatory yet as I was told by them that I need to wait for 2 months plus upon my reservation. So guys! If you're really interested, please do super early reservation."

For Americans, just a note that its communal seating when it gets busy. If there's an open seat at your table they will seat people there."
0,Fatima B.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"it was worth walking in the blazing hot, humid, heat to eat at this place. extremely cheap (7 MYR = less than $2 USD) for a delicious & decently sized small entree. he ordered the beef ball soup & i ordered the beef slices with dry noodles on the side. both were tasty! the beef balls & beef slices were like nothing we've ever tasted before. definitely something to try for its unique taste. i would recommend this place as a first or last stop to anyone visiting KL.

no air conditioning, but fans good enough to cool you down. cash only."
0,Cheryl H.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"We ordered the ""noodles with chicken "" dish by pointing with our fluent fingers and were delighted.  The food was piping hot, delicious, and the servings were huge, almost more than we could finish...but we forced ourselves. Thick, hot noodles with chunks of chicken all in a spicy sauce that was slurpingly delicious, we needed a fork and spoon to eat it all.  Inexpensive, I think we paid $3 each!  Oh my, it was good!"
0,Consuela P.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Soong Kee, which has been around for a couple of decades, is famed for its beef ball noodles and I grew up eating the dry noodles...still as good as I can remember and undoubtedly best in KL!  

The springy thin Hakka wantan-mee style noodles topped with tasty trademark finely minced meat crowned with the family's secret concoction of rich savory, aromatic mix of herbs and spices and garnished with boiled choi-sum makes this a very intoxicating delicious meal.

Tip: This is one place you must visit but do not expect a super clean stall or a 5 star restaurant."
0,Eileen W.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Great food for a great price. Beef balls are not mainstream in the Asian restaurants I visit back home in the United States.  But now I will look for them, hoping they are as good as these."
0,Wye Mun K.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Awesome beef ball noodles right in the heart of KL.

Another one of the oldest restaurants in KL which serves one of the best beef ball noodles in KL. This business started off as a roadside vendor with at least 50 years of history  and moved into a shop lot.

What's awesome about this place is cause you can choose from Meehoon to Wanton Mee noodles for your beef ball noodles let it be dry or soup!! The chilli sauce is awesome as well!

Be sure to drop by at night as well as they have porridge during the night. They serve steamed chicken along with the porridge which the chicken is very tender and juicy!

0,Nicole S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Soong Kee in my opinion has the best beef ball noodles. I frequent the one at Avenue k and its just as authentic and as good as the original restaurant that opened ages ago. I like how the quality has been maintained, the beef balls are still beefy and yummy and has a firm texture but is not hard. The noodles are springy and has that perfect consistency.

I definitely will go back to Soong Kee anytime i crave for beef ball noodles because no where else can make it the same."
0,Julian T.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"My dad has been bringing me here since I was a kid and everytime I visit it now and then, it brings back the old memories. Having said that, Soong Kee has been operating for a very long time. I've had many other beef ball noodles and there was never one that can beat the original taste this place has.

The beef here is full of flavor and taste. Be it the minced beef, beef ball, or beef strips, they are all delicious. I always add on some extra minced beef because of how good it taste with the noodles. Prices here have increased, but the quality has never been compromised."
0,T. H. S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Surrounded by business buildings, Soong Kee serves the best beef noodle and pork mince noodle in the center of the busy KL city. Their price is also relatively low. You can definitely have a satifying lunch/dinner with just below 10 ringgit per. I don't eat beef, but all of my friends and colleagues who had it before loved it instantly and now visiting the restaurant regularly. Their chilli sauce is great too! They also serve porridge at night time. It's not very spacious though, so it's a perfect place for a quick lunch."
0,Marie S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Highly recommended if you like good food and don't care about about appearance. You won't be disappointed with their food! Recommended items are:  beef ball noodles, steamed chicken and iced lemon tea."
0,Annabelle Y.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"Located in the hear of KL, it's hard to miss this kopitiam. As you probably guess from the signage, it's the beef ball noodles that make it happen here. It's packed every day especially at lunch hour but thankfully the space is air-conditioned so you can eat comfortably. Ordering is a breeze as well because all you gotta do is choose a bowl size depending how hungry you are. It comes with springy Hakka noodles topped with minced meat and choy sum. One thing about beef noodles is the sauce and of course, Soong Kee makes their own and it's a secret but who cares? It's above par! Not only that, the beef balls that accompany it has the elasticity of well beaten meat, very satisfying on the palate. Or if you're craving for chicken, do try the Lao You Ji located right in front of Soong Kee. Customer turnover rate is high here so I suggest taking those long catch up sessions elsewhere, coffee after lunch perhaps?=)"
0,Bryan S.,Soong Kee Beef Ball Noodles,"I've been visiting this place since I was a kid, when dad used to take us here for dinner and has always been a go to place for my relatives whenever they come over for visits from the States. I have to admit, my recent visits have left me a little disappointed. The beef noodle portions were smaller and the prices were higher. Goddammit inflation. They were also stingier with their minced pork. On the brightside the beef ball soup is still in my opinion one of the best around. The beef strips are unbelievably tender, that even after years of loyal patronage, me and family still rave about how it just melts whenever we're eating it."
0,Nick H.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I stayed at the hostel which is basically connected to TG's - every morning I had the roti canai with teh tarik for breakfast and it was honestly just perfect.

lovely flaky roti canai with a light curry on the side. The pulled tea was never too sweet or too astringent. The guys here are pretty nice and speak english fairly well as well.

I did also have a chicken & cheese murtabak for lunch here as well which was quite decent - lots of chicken but a little short on flavor. Would be perfect for someone who's grown a bit weary of strong curries and flavors. Quite filling and a fair price."
0,Ed T.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I came back recently, twice.

Last year I remember half the meals weren't available until after 12pm, so this time I came at 12:30. However, most of the items I wanted were STILL not available, and when I asked they said ""after 130pm"". This was really frustrating, because I had limited time in KL.

However, I did walk by the next day, at dinner time, and finally all the menu items were available. I got the naan, roti, and the murtabak (described as a pancaked stuffed with cheese but I'd say it's more like a naan and a quesadilla had a baby) and all three were really, really good. The naan and roti were really soft and some of the best I've ever had, and the murtabak is the first and only one I've ever seen but certainly I'll be looking for this from now on.

The lesson is, only come here when it's dark."
0,Hannah E.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"A simple muttar paneer and roti canai was all I was craving at the end of a kind of stressful day filled with hot, sunny walking on the edges of freeways. Tg's could choose to capitalize on the fact that it's located in backpacker row and charge more than MYR 8-9 for that set meal, but it doesn't, and thanks for that!

Really creamy paneer and ghee visibly trickling and pooling atop the thicker curry like watercolor on paper make this a delight to look at and to eat."
0,Rod M.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"One of our major objectives upon arriving in Kuala Lumpur was to eat as much roti as possible.  We experimented with a few spots, but TG's was the clear winner. We visited them every morning for our roti canai breakfast and loved every bite.

The roti at TG's is made fresh to order, which I think is one of their key's to success. It is also wonderfully flaky and tender. Truly just right! It is accompanied by a great curry which you can sop up with your roti.  

TG's has a complete menu of other times, most of which we did not try, too focused on the roti. We did have some veggies and enjoyed a number of their fresh fruit juices, coffees and teas. The mango lassi and pineapple juice were big hits."
0,Chang L.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"This was actually one of the best meals I had in Kuala Lumpur. I found TG's on Yelp, of course. I found the service to be polite, the options plentiful, and the food delicious. Servings are smaller than typical Indian restaurant, or at least lunch portions, but we are just chubby Americans complaining. The owner/manager made some great recommendations for a variety of dishes to order and we enjoyed them all. One note: didn't like the ""lassi"", it was more like a smoothie. Great find overall!"
0,Alice T.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Solid Indian food. It's an open-air restaurant near Jalan Alor. Lots of seating. You can also see the buffet of curries available as well as someone making fresh roti.

We had:
- Lamb biryani with vegetables (18RM). Served as overcooked biryani rice with a side of lamb curry, rather than lamb cooked into the rice. Two solid vegetable sides (looks like vegetables-of-the-day) of cabbage and marinated squash. Lamb was very tender. Curry was buttery, but not at the same spice level of really delicious Indian food.
- Ikan (fish) curry with 2 vegetables (9RM). Served with lots of rice, a thick fish steak on top of the rice, curry on the side, and two vegetable sides of bean sprouts and green beans. The white fish was flavorful and not dry. Watch out for bones. The curry paired well with the fish and rice, but wasn't mind-blowing. All of the food was also lukewarm.
- Roti canai (1.20RM). Yum! Fresh roti that was light and easy to scarf down. Served with dahl (lentils) that was pretty mediocre.
- Mango lassi (6RM). Less yogurty, more like a mango and pineapple smoothie. Still refreshing.
- Pulled tea/teh tarik with ice (2.50RM). Good! Not too sweet like I was expecting. Smooth taste with a strong tea flavor."
0,Karine K.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Very reasonable and tasty food, especially for breakfast.
Drinks are a little too sweet for me. Had to ask to put less sugar in mine.
Our favorite was double cheese roti."
0,Anthony C.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"I lived down the street from this place as well as the central night market area... Wow! The BEST mango lassi.  I even got it to go a few times and always had it when I was eating there.  The roti is excellent and you can see them making it right then and there.  The dosa is pretty well done as well!  Their curries are flavorful as well as the sauces that come with the roti.  I also enjoyed their roti canai (I think?) which is roti, cut up and then fried as if it was a stir fried noodle dish.  A must stop by if you're in the area!!"
0,Richard R.,TG's Nasi Kandar,It's located on a back street and has a modest appearance but the food stands out as exceptional and a great value.  We went for dinner but breakfast is served as well.  My wife had all vegetarian but I had a chicken dish.  We just loved it.

0,Linh B.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"A good Malaysian eatery in the center of the city! The price is very cheap (6 MYR for a cool fresh coconut, 11-14 MYR for main dish and 1-3 MYR for add-on veggies) compared to restaurants in the mall. I am not a fan of Malaysian food but this place isworths a try"
0,Abraham M.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"The place is basic, but the food is really great! Their best plate is Roti, but all the food is very delicious! We asked also a cold coconut an tea tharik is awesome! Simply the best place to eat Malayan and Indian food"
0,Matt S.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Excellent roti, super cheap and fast friendly service. We tried a couple of different types of roti and weren't disappointed. Easy to find location. Would recommend it to anyone and would go back"
0,Byron L.,TG's Nasi Kandar,Very good bread. Naan roti and all the possible breads available are very good. Curry and sides that come with the breads are decent. This place has a very street vibe. Price is good.
0,Flag S.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Indian and ""local Indian"" cuisine. Cheap, good cheap juices too. A great quick stop before/after nearby jalan alor night food market. Quality, tasty and open 24h. What more would anyone want?"
0,Burhan H.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"Everytime i have work around KL i'd always stop by for lunch here. The space is cozy and the service is wonderful. Theres a motel for travelers within restaurant so you'll probably see alot of foreigners here too. Let's talk about food. They have the usual 'mamak' food like roti canai and such but i never got to try them. Instead i usually have their rice with their currys. Love it. One thing to highlight though is that if you're coming over by car, its not really easy to find a parking space here at lunch time on weekdays (12pm-2pm). The price is also reasonable as i usually hv to pay around rm12 for a plate of rice with chicken, veggies, curry and a drink."
0,Karla C.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"not many reviews for this place on yelp but has been rated #1 on trip advisor. this may have been my most enjoyable meal while in KL even after visiting the street food market. i enjoyed the authenticity of the meal, ambiance, the service was quick and very inexpensive after converting CAD$. location was really easy to find as long as you have google maps."
0,Dor R.,TG's Nasi Kandar,"TG's is delicious, inexpensive, authentic Indian/Malaysian/Thai food. Garlic chicken and butter chicken are tasty. Try the crispy roti as a dessert! Will definitely be back with my family."
0,Nicole S.,113 Food Court,"113 food court is one of the best Chinese food courts near me. I say this because there are so many stalls at least 30-40 stalls and all selling different types of foods and some that you can't get at other food courts.  This food court is also very big, airy and clean. Service as usual at food courts is good and you get your drinks fast.

The prices are normal food court prices and my favorite food here is the chicken wings, the kolok mee, the wantan mee, bak kut teh. Everything here is good and definitely worth a visit. Parking is not easy though especially on weekday evenings. You can hardly get parking inside, so you have to park along the road."
0,Danny S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"A shroud of darkness envelops me, and the sense I've relied on so heavily since inception becomes numb.

I hold onto the shoulders of my guide, creating a human train like we used to create back in kindergarden: oh how glorious those days were. Woe is me!

Now, the belly of the beast has completely consumed me, and I have no choice but to play fiddle to its mighty beat.

The bouncy flesh of my booty thankfully finds a chair that welcomes it, and I have to grab blindlessly at the table to locate a fork, spoon, and the vodka on the rocks I had ordered.

My transformation into a half-wolf, half-husky has made considerable progress and my sense of smell, taste, hearing, and touch are enhanced from the death of vision.

Each course and dish is a blindfolded experiment- a true delight to the senses!

My jaw chomps down on I don't even know what but I know I like what I'm tasting.

""I'll have what I'm having!!!"" I loudly think to myself.

After the last morsel is consumed, I human-train with my guide back to reality and finally I see the light."
0,Erin P.,Dining In The Dark KL,"This is the best restaurant I have visited since I arrived in Asia 3 weeks ago. The food was phenomenal and the experience was truly unique. I have never experienced anything like it before but I hope I am able to again. The staff did a great job preparing us for the meal so that we were not scared going into the dining room, and the darkness experts were extremely kind and helpful. The food was also so tasty and I wish I could have eaten more of it. The portions were the perfect size and I was extremely satisfied after the meal. Overall a 10/10 experience that I would highly recommend to anyone in Kuala Lumpur. Such an amazing meal!"
0,Jen L.,Dining In The Dark KL,"I heard this place in social media and that everyone was commenting,  it was a great experienced and what made me curious is how you eat in the dark? So i bought a Groupon for Rm75 they waived Rm150 which is a pretty good deal.

I went the other day and i really love the friendly vibe welcoming me with a complimentary cocktail drink and we needed to guess the drink - not going to tell you if not you will know the answer. this is test your sense of taste. Another game was to find 4 safety pins in a small bowl of rice and it took me 10 minutes. This is to test your sense of touch and another game is when your partner is blindfolded and need to fix back shapes to a board with your guidance - sense of hearing.

Then  we were ready to go inside, my heart was full of excitement, we dont even know what is the food being served, a blind man escorted us in the pitch black dark place and brought us to our seats. My partner was trying to figure out where we were going and being seated. Our appetizer was served in 4 small pates on a board and in a pitch black room, my hands was more focused touching and feeling the bowl before i eat with my hands. My eyes tends to automatically close in the dark without me realizing. Soup came in 2 small cups - a mushroom soup and parsnip soup. Then the main course came in 3 small plate which was lobster with pineapple sauce, slice octopus with apple cinamon sauce and i forgot the other one. I love the the mash potatoes! I could tell you the menu because they changed it every month. Then the dessert came in 4 plates and 1 small cup which was the jackfruit ice cream.  

I honestly love the food as it tested our sense of test in different flavours such as parsnip, the lavender creme brulee, the apply cinammon sauce and the jackfruit ice cream. I never talked in the dark before while eating and it feels weird, feels like your talking alone. I never had a 3 plates of main course food to eat before!

What a great experience and after you come out from the dark, you will be given a feedback form and a look at the food menu. I met the manager and he explained the concept and all. Really interesting place.

P:S: You might want to bring more money here. Just the 4 course meal cost RM236 excluding other chargers and drinks, luckily they waived off RM150 if not my partner needs to pay RM300 for 2 pax."
0,Nadia S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"We wanted to try something a little different for our anniversary dinner and I'm glad that chose to have dinner at Dining in The Dark. Prior to the visit, I had heard mixed reviews on the place, but decided to go anyway.

We actually couldn't find the place at first as it is situated on the first floor, amidst other establishments. The signage leading up to the restaurant is quiet, unassuming yet full of promise, a precursor of the dining experience that we were about to have,

As the place requires you to reserve your spot in advance, they knew who we were as soon as we walked in. I thought that was a nice touch. First, we played a little game of find the paperclips in a cocktail glass of rice. Would have been easy had we not been blindfolded. It was surprisingly tough and really helped to make us realise how difficult it must be to go through life blind.

After the game (which was accompanied by a welcome drink), we were introduced to our wait staff for the night, a nice lady who was medically blind. She was very gentle as she told us to hang on to her shoulder as we descended into the darkness. Honestly, I was a little freaked out initially, but I was amazed at how my sense of hearing seemed to sharpen in the presence of darkness. My sense of touch seemed to be on hypermode too.

The highlight, however, was the food. It was beyond delicious. The chef knew his food chemistry alright. It is difficult to explain how it felt like to eat in the dark. When I told some people about it, their reaction was, ""Just turn off the light at home and eat la!"". A little simplistic but then again, this experience is probably better suited for the more curious type.

We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It really helped to build empathy for the visually impaired, and amplified our gratitude for the sense of sight!"
0,Elizabeth S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Such a fun experience. We stayed just up the street and passed it several time. It sounded like a bit of a gimmick until I noticed it had one of the higher ratings of any restaurant in KL. My husband was fascinated by the clicks the servers made to alert each other of their presence and still tells our friends the story of our meal, 2 years later! The food was delicious, and I found that I'm terrible at discerning individual flavors, but it was a fun date spent trying to decipher each one. The waiters were kind and I felt extraordinarily humbled by experiencing for a couple hours what they experience every day as a blind person. Thanks for such a memorable time!"
0,Ian L.,Dining In The Dark KL,"You get the gist. Basically, the restaurant requires diners to sit in a pitch-black restaurant.
   The menu is pre-set. So, before heading in the restaurant, you have no idea what you're going to eat. The menu was only revealed at the end of the night. We were blindfolded at the door and led by blind staff.  After taking our seats, staff explained the setting of table.
   The meal arrived promptly as we savor the dishes in pitch black environment. Half-way through, my partner couldn't take it and left. It was a dining experience so strange that I find it once is more than enough."
0,Ida S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Service is very friendly and nice, and I enjoyed the beginning of the dinner. However it gets kind of boring after a couple of courses since there is no visual stimuli, darkness doesn't provoke conversation and at the end of the meal I just kept waiting for something to happen. Food is just alright, a couple of dishes are very tasty and others not at all. Still, it's always fun to try something new, but I think once is enough."
0,Benjamin S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Dining in the Dark is a dining experience that I feel everyone should go through at least once in their life. It is a real eye opener - no pun intended.

I bought my girlfriend to this restaurant and when we first reached the restaurant they invited us to play a simple game where you are required to find a number of paper clips in a container of rice while being blindfolded; I found it extremely difficult and took a long time to find it.  My girlfriend on the other hand was surprisingly good at this game and managed to find all the paper clips in a way shorted time than me - impressive! After that we were led into the actual dining area and to our table by one of the waiters where it is completely pitch black. We were served shortly and then taught by the waiter some of the rules of locating our utensils or glasses in the dark and also how to eat when you cannot see anything. The experience was amazing and I would find doing day to day activities really hard; I could never seem to locate where my mouth is. Finally, when we were done through all the courses, we were led out once more by the waiter and asked to guess the food that we had. As I am not an expert on food, I only managed to guess one or two correct- terrible, i know!

However, it is a bit costly at RM150 per person, but it is an experience worth feeling as it really helped me to appreciate life more and whatever we are gifted with. Also, I have to mention that the waiters there are blind and it is really touching to see how passionate they are at what they're doing."
0,Julie Y.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Nervous thoughts filled my head as I lounged outside Dining in the Dark, the first of its kind in KL. All I knew was that in a few minutes, I will be led inside a pitch-black restaurant and will be having my meal in the dark with other strangers. The preset menu will not be revealed until the meal is over to maintain the element of surprise. This unique concept was introduced by restaurateur Werner Kuhn who wanted to bring his guests on a gastronomic journey focusing on purely the other senses except for sight. The service staff consists of visually impaired and blind waiters who will lead and guide the tasting session.

I was ordered to store away any mobile phones or watches beforehand in the lockers provided to ensure that there will be no light inside the room. Dutifully, I lined up alongside a handful of other strangers and placed my hands on the shoulder of the person in front of me. A blind waiter greeted us and proceeded to lead the group inside the pitch-black restaurant while constantly reminding us not to let go in case we get stranded. The first step inside the dark room immediately stripped us of our sight and proved to be too much to handle for some as the girl behind me let out a yelp and ran off into the opposite direction as fear took over. I took a nervous gulp and continued on.

The restaurant did a great job at ensuring every single inch of light was covered as I could not make out anything and it was terrifying. Slowly the waiters led us one by one to our tables, as we struggled to find our seats and we were briefed on where each cutlery was located at in front of us. Thankfully, there were no knives in place as that could be a catastrophe. Only chatter could be heard as strangers seated together conversed to ease the tension. Let's just say this may not be a good place to bring a date as there is no escape route though it forced people to chat instead of occupying themselves with their gadgets.

The waiters clearly knew their way around as sight wasn't an issue to them since they were already used to being visually impaired. Though it was a three course meal, it was one of the longest meal of my life as time seemed to slow down with the absence of sight. I picked at my food slowly while stabbing what I could on the plate with my fork though it was a little hard to pinpoint at the rubbery texture in my mouth. There was also a surprise piano performance halfway throughout our meal by a talented blind pianist which made us appreciate our sight even more. At the end of the meal, we were lined up again and led out of the room much to our relief. There was a good laugh around the room as our meal was revealed to us. Though the Dining in the Dark experience was a unique one, my first visit will definitely not warrant a second one as the food was mediocre as the focus was clearly more on the entire experience."
0,Lisa H.,Dining In The Dark KL,"This is a wonderful experience for many reasons. Our guide AK was delightful, attentive and a great instructor. We were most pleased with the appetizer course but all were tasty. There was a little more sauce then we prefer on the entree selections. Some of the desserts were not preferable for our sweet tooth. The concept is genuinely unique and teaches you to focus on senses a sighted person is not as aware of. The human side of relating to a blind persons challenged is heightened which leads to greater awareness and appreciation for gifts we take fir granted. Way more than a dining experience. Thank you!"
0,Bryan S.,Dining In The Dark KL,"Dining the dark is all about the often repeated notion that the loss of one sense is compensated with the enhancement of our other senses hence crafting a dining experience unlike any other. Personally, I found it to be a harrowingly hilarious experience more so than an orgasmic culinary escapade of the senses. The words Pitch black is an understatement in describing the form of vision you have here. Journeying to the fancy side of dining is usually one that doesn't often excite me with its small portions and supposedly world class crafted menu, which I have to say in terms of food isn't totally wrong about dining in the dark with its standard menu that changes every week. However what makes this dining exploit worth those extra Ringgits, is the experience and that is what you're paying for. Whether with a friend or that special someone, the memory of Dining in the dark will no doubt be forever engraved in your mind."
0,Martin M.,Madam Kwan's,"If you're a foreigner visiting Kulai Lumpar, you can't go wrong with Madam Kwan's. Everything is decently priced and you can feast like a king (drink + appetizer + main course + dessert) for around $7 - $8 US a person.

I'm not sure how the Nasi Lemak fares against other local joints but it was the best Nasi Lemak I had while in my stay in Malaysia. The rice was super rich and buttery, and the meat was extremely flavorful.

I had to also order Kee Twao since it resembles one of my favorite Chinese comfort foods growing up - Chow Fun. It tastes similar but it definitely has more spice and kick to it than what we Chinese put into it.

Their drinks are also a must-get. Ask the servers for recommendations, we tried 5 different drinks and they were all good."
0,Gary Y.,Madam Kwan's,"Oh my nasi bojari! Madam Kwan's has some really tasty stuff for a reasonable price. 120 RM for 2 mains, one veggie dish, and a set of combo satay (the sauce was excellent). Definitely get the nasi bojari if you have to pick between that and nasi lemak. While the nasi lemak was good, nasi bojari is superior in every aspect down to the rice. Definitely didn't regret taking a chance at this place."
0,Angelo B.,Madam Kwan's,"It's a nice restaurant serving tasty Malay food. I'm pretty sure this is more expensive than most of the other Malay places. But I felt it was worth the money, and actually still very cheap compared to US price levels.

The beef rendang was delicious, and the beef was cooked well.

Curry laksa was good. Also nice was the curry chicken skewers.

I'd recommend against the mocktails. They are not worth the premium over the regular drinks. For example the only difference between the lychee drink and the lychee lemon mocktail (except the price) was that the lychee lemon drink also comes with a slice of lemon!"
0,M M.,Madam Kwan's,"Sitting at one of the most prestigious mall in Kuala Lumpur, the place is pretty crowded.  The food,  mixed satay , the dipping sauce is amazing.  The noddle dishes are also pretty decent."
0,Nicole N.,Madam Kwan's,"This place is really popular but I feel like the quality of food went down. The sauce and plates we got were not as vibrant as we had hoped for. A lot of it seemed a bit over cooked, over priced and the portions also seem tiny."
0,Elee J.,Madam Kwan's,"I think I got the Beef Rendang. Whatever it was, it was the best meal I had during my short stay in Malaysia.

The meat was flavorful.  The rice was so good I had to order an extra side to eat with the meat.

Place is located inside KLCC.  So if you are planning to visit the Petronas Towers, definitely give this place a try for local cuisine.  It's not fancy and it is rather small, but that is all made up for in the great tasting food."
0,Sylvia K.,Madam Kwan's,"This place is located on the 4th floor of the (air-conditioned) Suria KLCC Mall inside the Petronas Towers Building. A friend of mine recommended this place for its nasi lemak. We went around 6pm on a Thursday evening and didn't have to wait for a table.

There was a lot to choose from the menu, but we ordered the nasi lemak (since it came highly recommended) as well as the curry laksa. The food came out quickly. The nasi lemak was good! The coconut rice and curry part was delicious. The chicken was just a tad dry. It also came with what they call shrimp floss and anchovies with some kind of sauce and a hard boiled egg. The curry laksa was yummy. I liked the noodles and the broth and the veggies and tofu were good. Again, the chicken meat was dry.

The place has a nice ambience and is very clean. The service was good when we got it - there were a lot of servers on staff but sometimes it was hard to get their attention, like when we wanted to order or when we wanted to get the check - had to flag someone down. By the time we left, the restaurant (which is pretty big) was full and there were people waiting outside!"
0,Hans D.,Madam Kwan's,"This place was great! We just had a business meeting in the Petronas Twin Towers and since we were only in KL for one day, something proper Malay was high on our agenda. We had the Nasi Lemak, Nasi Bojari, Malay Satay, Otak-Otak, and some Assam Prawns. All of this for a business lunch at the ridiculously cheap price of €45 for three people ..."
0,Will W.,Madam Kwan's,"Fine dining at the mall seems to be a thing in Asia. Well I liked it, its a dressed up fancier version of food you'd get on the street. This would be a good place to take people who are want to try the local foods, but are hesitant to eat street food (their loss I know.) Anyway the service was good and the food was quite good. I had a very nice Laksa here, the broth was hot and it packed some heat in the spice department. So much so that my Vietnamese friend tapped out and couldn't handle more than two bites. I thought the beef rendang was a bit dry but still serviceable. Excellent Nasi Lemak, the mix of textures and flavors in the dish were spot on. They make a great Barley Ice as well.

I preferred the street food on Jalan Alor, but I don't mind this place at all."
0,Peter D.,Madam Kwan's,"Since I'm a sucker for Mall Chinese Food, I thought I might as well try some Mall Malaysian Food.

I was hoping to tuck into some curry laksa, or perhaps the nasi lemak. However, my wife doesn't care at all what I want, and so we got the appetizer sampler (Madam's Starters for 2) with the intention of ordering more afterward. Other than the mildly interesting but ultimately underwhelming otak-otak, it was solid fried food that could really have been served anywhere in the world. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to go out of your way for.*

Unfortunately, the service leaves much to be desired. Maybe chain spots are the same throughout the world, but our servers took a cue from my wife, and really couldn't have cared less about me and anything I wanted (i.e. a menu, drinks, more food, a check, etc.).

So we just left and ate more street food, which was probably for the best anyway.

*We should've gotten the curry laksa, wife. Why must you always ruin my life?"
0,Joann Y.,Madam Kwan's,"In Kuala Lumpur for the weekend and wanted to try Malaysian food! Since our group was quite large, it proved to be a bit hard to eat together at a market, which I would have liked, so Madam Kwan's was the best option!

We had the beef rendang, nasi lemak, fried rice, curry laksa, and some drinks. I will say the food was nice. It wasn't the best that I've never had but it was good. The curry laksa had noodles that were too soft for my taste. I prefer noodles al dente, but tasty overall! I actually really enjoyed the beef rendang. The meat was nice and tender like pulled pork! Portions aren't humongous by the way, which was good for us. What was different about the fried rice was that there was dried fish in it. Not good for those who don't like seafood though!

The service was okay. I understand that restaurants in Malaysia are sit, eat, and go. We did not fulfill that requirement so I'm sure we took up too much time in there! But with a party of 6 this restaurant was able to accommodate us all. For that, thanks Madam Kwan's!

Overall, this restaurant was good, but not exceptional. The combination of the nice interior, decent price, alright service, and good food earned it 4 stars from me."
0,Maylan B.,Madam Kwan's,"It was our first time in Malaysia and we were looking for authentic cuisine. We ended up here. The place was full when we walked in. The host was attentive and got us seated right away.

The ambiance was welcoming. Decor were eye catching, the ones that make you feel like you're in the right place.

We ordered Laksa Soup and a chicken dish and shaved ice. The food was fresh, the portions were filling. It's only 3 stars because we asked for mild level of spiciness but the Laksa soup burns you mouth. I wish they could adjust this as not everyone have high tolerance to spicy food.

It was a memorable experience overall. Thank you Malaysia."
0,Jacob V.,Madam Kwan's,First the food was actually quite good. Tasty and exceptional. However the service is probably the worst. The server Kelly appeared to be irritated when we asked for anything. Another male server also forgot to bring extra glasses and showed his displeasure. I felt horrible about the service and sad for this service given to fellow Malaysians.
0,David P.,Madam Kwan's,"Enjoyed a nice filling and very tasty dinner at Madam Kwan's in Kuala Lumpur. Started with the mixed Malaysian Satay, the peanut sauce was fantastic, I was scraping the bowl at the end. For the main course I went for the large and delicious Nasi Bojari, rice was super flavorful, chicken tender, prawns with nice spice and the beef smooth and silky. Service was very efficient and friendly, they deal with the large throughput of guests very well. I recommend for a nice meal in KL!"
0,DD C.,Madam Kwan's,"Madam Kwan's is at a decent location inside Suria KLCC Mall. We would like to taste classic Malaysian food but could not endure the street stands under hot sun, humid and sweaty air. Madam Kwan's setting  would meet our desire.  We ordered Malaysian Satay Mix (馬來式串燒, $5.20, a classic and tasty Satay meat); Nasi Bojari (關姐三色飯, $7.20; a house specialty with an interesting combination of chicken leg, shred pork meat and seafood, came along with a ball of ""3-color rice"") ; and Rice-coconut (椰香飯, $0.93; in case that there's not enough rice for 2 hungry people). We also ordered a Red Bean Ice (紅豆冰 $2.40; for nostalgic reason). Hot Chinese Tea, costed $1.65, was flavorsome. We enjoyed the first dinner in Kuala Lumpur."
0,Johnny Z.,Madam Kwan's,"Normal traditional Malay restaurant, nothing special, wouldn't come again or recommend it"
0,Naz H.,Madam Kwan's,"I was looking forward to a meal out here with my family of 9. We were here for opening fast during Ramadan.

At first, things were looking decent - food initially came out quick and then, half of our dishes never came in. Despite numerous talks to rectify the situation with a couple of different servers, the dishes just never came for a good half hour. By then, most of everyone who had food, had finished or just about finished.

When the dishes finally came (three orders of the Mushroom Chicken Rice - which should be one of the simplest dishes), my mother's order was pink: RAW.

And even the dishes that did arrive - well, if you've had local food anywhere at a homemade style place, or at a hawker stall, well, Madam Kwan's is overhyped, overpriced and far from authentic."
0,Anna A.,Madam Kwan's,"Madam Kwan's in KLCC is easily one of the busiest restaurants in the whole mall. Every day during lunch hour you will find the place packed and people waiting in line outside. They even have a waiting area outside their store since they have grown so accustomed to huge crowds! But fret not, usually the wait is about 20 minutes and then you get a table as their staff is very efficient so the second a table is available, they will clean it and get the next party seated.

Food here is typical Malaysian and you will find items like Char Koay Teow, Nasi Lemak, Satay and Otak-otak among others. Apparently, this restaurant was the brainchild of one actual Madam Kwan who came up with all of the dishes.

For me, the food here is alright but the prices are just exorbitant! I quite enjoy their Char Koay Teow and Hokkien Noodles as well as their Banana Fritters with ice cream for dessert (so so good!) but otherwise find it too expensive for typical Malaysian dishes. Service is excellent though, I have to say. I am impressed that their staff are trained so well."
0,Nicole S.,Madam Kwan's,"Okay, Madam Kwan's is by far my all time favorite Malaysian restaurant. So excited to be reviewing this place. I love everything on the menu but like many of the frequent patrons, i always opt for either the nasi lemak or nasi bojari. Sometimes i cant decide so me and daddy order one of each and share share. This way we get to eat both! For dessert i either have the super delicious cendol or the sago gula melaka. Both equally sweet and satisfying. I've been to many of the outlets and the food is standard all over, i appreciate this fact because you dont want your favorite nasi lemak tasting different at different outlets.

My favorite outlet is at Pavilion. Why? Cause Madam Kwan herself is there most days. Yes, yes the real Madam Kwan, as in the lady you see on the menu. She's so cute and humble, she greets you as you enter her restaurant and even seats you to your table. Was super starstruck the first time i saw her and told her she made the best nasi lemak ever!

As for pricing, to me its reasonable but i know some people (my boyfriend) that find it pricey for usual hawker food. He doesn't understand why he has to pay rm15 for a plate of fried rice when he can get it for rm5 at a hawker stall. Well to each their own."
0,Ian L.,Madam Kwan's,"Famous for their local cuisine, Madam Kwan is an institution. Serving Malaysian food in a high-end setting (read: clean, modern), Madam Kwan has a few outlets across the town.
    You will find their standout dishes like Nasi Lemak and Nasi Beroja as well as other local delicacies like Ipoh hor fun, laksa, deep fried squid and beef rendang. There are all delicious and well-prepared. If you dine at their Pavilion outlet, sometimes you would even spot Madam Kwan herself! (yes, she is real).
   Well, to be honest, you can find similiar food (if not better) in your warung or other restaurants. At Madam Kwan's you pay more for the ambience, service and setting. And some reasons, this seems to be a very popular choice for Singapore tourists."
0,Sin Yee Y.,My Burger Lab,"Believe it or not, myBurger Lab is where I have my first burger in my life! This place is always packed yet it worths your time to queue for the most delicious burger in the world!

If you have not been having any burger from myBurger Lab, you probably have seen some photos of it. Yes, the black bun caught my attention!

There are a lot of choices, chicken, beef and vegetarian burgers are served. Order it in a la carte, or make it a set with extra RM7.50z You will get free flow soft drink and a side.

My all-time-flavor is Chicken Say Cheese while Danny's one is Beef Beautiful Mess. We normally order one a la carte and one set. Trust us, both are full! We share our side and drink which able to make it an awesome dinner!

Yes, you can only have it from 5.30pm onwards. I seriously wish they can consider to open in the morning, or at least, afternoon!

Btw, I heard that OUG branch queue isn't as bad as Seapark. You probably can think of coming OUG branch. ;)"
0,Brendan L.,My Burger Lab,"Good food, Great service.

Staff is very well trained, all with great, freindly personality - something you are not very used to in Malaysian eateries, outside of fine dining."
0,Jasmine C.,My Burger Lab,"This is the branch I frequent most of all due to accessibility reasons. On weekends the crowd can be quite overwhelming but the servers are usually on hand to help with seating and organising the queue. However, I am not too fond of how close the tables are placed to each other. I would enjoy talking to my friend more if I didn't have to keep raising my voice above the conversations of the neighboring tables. However, if you are dining alone, the neighboring conversations can keep you entertained while waiting.

The burgers are the reason we keep coming back! Juicy, well-grilled/well-fried patties with inventive pairings! My current favourite is the Bait & Switch burger with features budu sauce! I love it when Malaysian ingredients are featured! These two evenings we had the Geisha (Wakame, Japanese kyuri cucumbers and chicken patty with sesame dressing), Spicy Hawaiian (Chicken burger with pineapple and their famous red sauce) and a special customised vegan burger.

They are currently offering two sides, fries and mash, so we usually go for the fries as it's really tasty with the red sauce!

Love that they still keep coming up with new burgers! Always check out their social media for new inventions, which usually comes with an introductory discount! :)"
0,Steph S.,My Burger Lab,"The line was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it! The first time I went here, they were closed, so I was sooo happy to catch them when they are open. I had fun making my own lab burger creation and chatting with the cooks. My friend who came with me is vegetarian, and she really appreciated the options My Burgerlab had for her. All in all, delicious!"
0,Penny W.,My Burger Lab,"Thankfully, Burgerlab opened a few branches and it is no longer super packed. I can still remember the queue was so long, people were queuing outside the shop. I visited both Seapark and OUG branch before and I prefer the OUG branch because parking isn't much of a hassle and there are less people even on weekend.

I've tried a few burgers before and so far, the best is The Hulk but they don't always have it. The portion for The Hulk is HUGE, hence the name.  Plus they have avocado in it too. Yumyum. The hands down weirdest burger is BlueBlack (Only available in OUG, if I'm not mistaken) Blue cheese is used in BlueBlack and when I took a bite of it, my taste buds went next level but it did not stop there ... Since it tasted weird, so I ate it with tomato sauce and oh my, believe it or not, it tasted like apple! Say whatttttt! My friends and I were freaking amazed by the combination.

They changed their fries a few months ago and I prefer the previous one. The sauce that accompanies the fries is really good too but it can be quite spicy."
0,Julie Y.,My Burger Lab,"I started coming to the OUG branch when the Seapark branch was getting too crowded and the one hour wait was ridiculous. I like how service is always efficient here as they actually have staff to come up to you and brief you about their menu to help you make your choice.

Their burgers are still the best i've tried among all the other burger places as their patty is juicy and moist sandwiched in between soft charcoal buns with yummy lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms. My favourite is the A+ burger as its the best of the lot and most appealing to me.

Their fries are also generously flavoured with herbs and the dip is excellent, you'll be asking for seconds. The wait at the OUG branch isn't as bad as Seapark so i rather come here."
0,Edmond Y.,My Burger Lab,"Best burgers hands down! I've been a burger eater since I could eat with my fingers at 2 years old and these burgers are crafted with real care. I've tried a few different burger selections here and their flavours are all very well balanced. It's not just burgers, it's burgers made with care.

Not cheap, but with burgers so mouth watering, the stomach trumps the wallet."
0,Intan N.,My Burger Lab,"In my previous post I have compared KGB to Burger lab and said that KGB is the winner of the two burger joints.

To this day, I still believe that KGB has the upper hand. For instance Burger lab has a self-pick up system which I do not appreciate since the prices are about the same as KGB. Burger lab's location is a bit less accessible and the parking is horrendous if you go during the peak hours.

Although that is just my opinion, some people like the different take of Burger lab's burgers. The only thing I like about them is that their cheese is crispy instead which I think is interesting. Though if you do want to check this place out I suggest the Elvis burger not on the menu anymore it is a peanut butter burger, it sounds strange but oddly one of those thing you either love or hate"
0,Julian T.,My Burger Lab,"I wrote about he Seapark outlet before this, but I'll like to talk about this outlet here in OUG as there is a little difference. People who never got the chance to visit the Burgerlab in Seapark would not know that the menu here is more limited. There are a few choices that aren't available in OUG. The ones that are available however, still carries the delicious tag from the original outlet.

The burgers here are as good, sometimes tasting better if you're a frequent customer and can tell the difference. It is the prefered option for a less crowded Burgerlab, but don't be fooled, it's not always empty. A couple times, it was really crowded, maybe everyone thought alike an ended up here."
0,Ryan Q.,My Burger Lab,"Do not come here if you're hungry, because you'll be embracing your inner cannibalism whilst waiting in the long queue. Thankfully I've already eaten something and it was my cousin who was starving( Sorry though ). It's a unique twist to the original adaption of a burger. This time featuring black buns made out of charcoal. Also, their fries, although fried, are kinda tasty. My cousin was delighted with the sight of his burger. He was in a food coma after finishing that burger, it was that good according to him. Maybe I'd give this a try one day, since you can substitute their meat for a tofu patty. Till then, I'll be anticipating."
0,Su Zanne C.,My Burger Lab,"A local burger join that is famous for it's charcoal bun burgers, crispy fried cheese, and house sauce that plankton would want to try and get his hands on. I ordered the A+ burger and the crispy cheese did it for me. There were so much hype on the fries as well which I thought was alright until I dipped it this special semi-spicy orange coloured sauce. They're not very generous with the sauce despite its high demand, but you can try your luck by asking for more at the pick-up counter.

Expect a long queue, but fret not, the waiters will keep you entertained by explaining what's on the menu down to the details of what goes on in the burger as you wait."
0,Shearlee L.,My Burger Lab,"Been hearing so much bout this, finally gave it a try & I get what's the hype all about now! The rain on a Sunday evening clearly didn't stop lovers from coming because it was full house when we arrived! I quite like the self service concept of the place (yay to no service charge too). The menu though a little confusing, was illustrated on the chalk wall and they have a good variety of  beef, chicken, vegetarian and also sides! I took the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken, and my boyfriend took the Cthuhlu Beef.

Despite it being full, most tables are joint so the staff was nice and got us a place to seat within a minute. You are to hold on to your receipt and wait for your order number that can is displayed, like a bank which I think is so cool! You help yourself to drinks too at the bar where there are several choices.

On first glance, my chicken breast was so thick & huge, immediately warning me on it being tough and dry. But biting into it, it was anything but! Tender, moist and seasoned just right, I love it! The charcoal bun was soft and fresh too, and I love my slippery and tasty mushrooms in it. Only two things I didn't love was the dressing, a little too much and it tasted similar to thousand island just slightly spicier, and also the pineapple that I think is from the can. It would have made a huge difference if my pineapple was fresh and grilled, voila!! Also, I thought that the fries were cut and fried perfectly, not greasy at all, however I like my fries simple, and not overly seasoned with herbs like this ones. My boyfriend's beef burger was simply amazing, they had this black sauce called the Evil Cocktail Sauce and it is served with oysters. I am not too sure what else was in there but I took a bite and thought it was damn good! Probably even better than mine.

The set up of the place was really cool and it had plenty of character. I took a peak and saw about eight pair of gloved hands in the kitchen, no wonder our burgers were quick! It is a little pricey, about RM42 for the both of us, and only one of us had the set, but I'd definitely come back!"
0,Vanessa W.,My Burger Lab,"It was so jam when it comes to friday night especially on raining day and when your class ended late . So my course mates decided to go to this burger lab to have dinner . At first I did not want to go but my friends offer to fetch me so ofcourse I cannot reject them . It was a bit hard to find parking at that place and my friend actually use about 15 minutes to find a parking . But I feel that is worth it because their burger is so nice ! I can't remember what is the name of the burger that I have ordered but the burger is really delicious ! Is my first time visting the restaurant so i decided to ask the waitress for suggestions. She said that it was the best sellers  .The mushrooms in the burger with the black pepper sauce and the combination of chicken slice in the  charcoal bun make the burger is really perfect ! Besides , they also have fries and a soft drinks to complete the meal . The orange colour sauce for the fries is so nice ! A set of burger only cost RM 15 ++. I am sure I will visit them again !"
0,Halstene A.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"This is the closest ribs to back home I can find in KL so far. Tender, fall-off-the-bone slabs with an appropriate tangy BBQ sauce can be found here.  As a cautious/plain-Jane meat eater (I often prefer chicken over red meats), this place actually makes me look forward to and excited about eating pork.

Their sausages are also noteworthy and are served with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I usually order one of the sausages when I'm not up for the heavier slabs of rib option.

It's a chill and unpretentious restaurant, just how BBQ should be. The decor of mixed materials of wood and metal give the appearance of trendy, yet maintains the laid back/casual vibe that makes me enjoy eating there so much.

This is definitely a place to check out in the Sri Hartamas area or at their second location in Bangsar (although to date, I haven't gone to that one yet)."
0,Toby W.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Good food! Had ribs and were delicious , not falling off the bone but very tender, cocktails were good and got a free giant fish bowl cocktail to share at the end, it was undrinkable"
0,Sara M.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"There must be something in the pork ribs here, because they are addictive as hell!  

The first time I came here I made a mistake, I ordered pasta. Who on earth goes to a restaurant that specializes in ribs and orders pasta? That would be me. The pasta pale in comparison to the restaurant's signature dish. I've learned my lesson, I've repented. I now know that if you walk into a restaurant and more than five tables are having the same dish that is what you should order. I sat there waiting for my pasta, looking at all the tables around me all of which ordered the pork ribs. Lucky for me, my friend has ordered that too. I tried a little and was blown away, the ribs were so good. Coated in this sweet and savoury barbeque sauce, served on a rustic wooden board with a small bowl of awesome chili sauce, good god it was an explosion of flavours in my mouth.

The ribs portion is huge enough for two to share and it's reasonably priced too. After my first visit I knew I had to come back again to have the rib and I did. The restaurant get pretty crowded during dinner time, you can always call ahead to make a reservation. But be ready, most of their workers are foreigners and as helpful as they are sometimes it's hard you to understand them (and vice versa) when you call in to make a booking. I've encountered this many times and had to repeat myself over and over again. There's even once I had to call back to check on my reservation because I wasn't sure if my initial booking went through because I could not understand what the person on the line was saying."
0,Jen L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"I know that they are famous for the ribs and steak here but it was 11pm and i do not felt like eating something so meaty so instead i ordered something so creamy - cabonara.

One thing about pub food is that the food sometimes is damn good and sometimes they just cook to earn extra money and i feel like thier cabonara was creamy and good but TOO MUCH CHEESE THAT I FELT LIKE PUKING AFTER. There goes the calories of cheese. My partner ordered burger and it was terrible! My cabonara was RM22 and the burger cost Rm26 - expensive but not worth the delicious food.

The meat is not juicy, dry and the bacon was overcook and the side was just normal fries and sweet potato. Omg! it was bad. Definitely coming back to try the famous ribs and ducks."
0,Josephine N.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,Surprisingly GOOD! We had the Birthday platter which costs RM300 with a free bottle of wine. You can't get any more German than that! The platter consist of everything PORK! You will PORK till you DROP!
0,Marija S.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"WOW !

I am so shocked to see that someone has already been here, because this place opened just last week!

Me and my girlfriend were walking all over bangsar thinking it's time to check out a new place. We kept on making rounds around jalan telawi 1-2-3-4..We almost gave up and ended up where we just started : in front of a new place covered in balloons and friendly staff.

On a saturday evening this place was pleasantly crowded and seemed really social!

So we stayed and tried out some of their dishes!

I enjoyed salmon Caesar salad and my friend Hungarian sausage.

However, I saw some people having pork ribs and I knew for a fact that we've ordered wrong and next time I'm definitely checking out their ribs ;D

Enjoy your meal!"
0,Patience G.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"This is our 5th time to NBDD and the food is consistent. Their signature ribs is superb, juice and tasty! the Jamon platter is value for money. You will not get this anywhere else except in Spain itself! Service is ok but overall is just excellent!"
0,Goh K.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Excellent service and food although busy Saturday night. Tried their Father day menu, full platter of meat with 4 beers. Great stuff !! Genuine Food !!"
0,James L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Came here one afternoon and had a short stay and took only drinks and fries with 2 friends. We arrived at about 4pm and it's very quiet. The crowd didn't seem to arrive until about 630pm or so.

While chilling and having beer inside the outlet. I couldn't help but get turned off by the heavy nicotine smell that is infused into the restaurant. Getting a seat outdoors was definitely a better choice.

After finishing our drinks and fries, we ordered ribs and steak for take away. Food didn't take long to arrive and we get to enjoy everything at the comfort of the house. Price is pretty reasonable for such good food in my opinion."
0,Andy L.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"Aside from its hard-to-pronounce name, Naughty Babe Dirty Duck is a brand new venture around the area, and while their ribs and steaks are already winning the community.

Ah, but they never met me yet.

The portions served here are admittedly big, but I do not think that the cooks here are any good in differentiating between medium rare and well done. Perhaps that is the single reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 4 star, and with the ambience and the price itself, I can assure you that it will attract more patrons than a puddle of water attracts mosquitos.

That being said, I really like this place, but a mistake is a mistake, and I will love to come to this place... Months later."
0,Bryan S.,Naughty Babe Dirty Duck,"What I particularly like about this place is that the portions don't disappoint. I'll be the first person to admit to the fact that a restaurant's portion size serves as a sizeable determining factor as to whether or not I would patronize a place again and if we're going purely on that, I would come back here again. And again. And again. Naughty Babe Dirty Duck specializes in grilled pork ribs and other meaty creations of the porcine and duck variety. I ordered the grilled pork ribs and a half slab sets you back at around RM38. Tender and well-seasoned, it's decently sized and can easily be shared by a party of two with one or two appetizers on the side. With its catchy name and cozy yet cool vibe, this Hartamas newbie is a great hangout for foodies with an affinity for meat. Its central location makes it accessible but parking can be pain in the derriere"
0,Nicole N.,Lot 10 Hutong,"So many delicious hawker stalls conveniently tucked into one place!! Haven't been back to Malaysia in 5 years, so I was craving lots of street food and luckily Lot 10 Hutong literally had all the dishes I craved during my short trip in KL. The place was clean but a little hard to navigate since it was so big. I would recommend walking around to check out all the stalls/food options before purchasing!
Hokkein Prawn Mee is probably my favorite noodle dish besides the Laksa! Secret Penang Cafe does them perfectly: rich, fragrant broth with a strong shrimp (almost lobster-y) taste with a combo of mee siam and thick egg noodles along with shrimp, ribs, and pork slices. The soup is what gets me because I love the shrimpy, seafood taste and I would 100% recommend this dish!! It has a thin layer of chilli oil but isn't really that spicy. Traditionally, it is also served with sambal chilli on the side but its totally optional. (Compared to the popular Laksa, which has a stronger coconut milk taste, the Prawn Mee is more seafood and pork broth based in my opinion).
I also got the Chendol/Cendol from the only dessert shop in this plaza. It was pretty good too albeit different from the ones I've had in Penang (which is where I believe Cendol originated from). There was the green jelly and bean milk on ice and covered with coconut milk and syrup. Tip: I like get my dessert around the same time I get my main dish because the ice in the dessert can melt as you eat your main meal so you wont taste chunks of ice (that tends to dilute the sweetness) in your first few bites!
They also had bak kut teh, bbq pork and wonton noodles, curry noodles, loh mee noodles, and much more! Despite so many food stalls, I do wish that they had more dessert and drink options. For sure I would recommend this place to others exploring Malaysian food!"
0,Anchisa P.,Lot 10 Hutong,"3.5 stars. Popular food court in Lot 10 Shopping Centre - a food court collecting many of the famous Malaysian hawker stalls

- Food here tastes ok / quite average TBH but a plus for the variety it offers and a pretty nice / clean ambiance overall

- Some better dishes include the char kway teow and hokkien mee"
0,Ben Y.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Lots of selection and you can get a meal for between 5-10 USD.  

We chose two random places and both were good.  
One was the bak kuh teh stall and the other was the Penang one."
0,Jon C.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Great food, fast service but so many options you can barely choose.

The other thing is it's also organized like alley ways so you can get lost or not find what you're looking for.

There are a lot of tables to eat at, but the space to move around is a bit narrow.

However, the food, options and prices make up for it all. You're pretty much paying around 15 ringitts for a dish of noodles here at any place. And it'll be delicious. You just gotta decide which place and don't forget where it is."
0,Angelo B.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Fairly large range of vendors in an air conditioned food court with lots of seating.

We tried a couple of dishes. Everything was fairly decent (although the food was better at the other places I've been). Reviews mention that it's pricey but i didn't think it was too much worse (eg the dish we got at restaurant kin kin earlier in the day was 8, but 11 here).

I wouldn't really recommend coming here unless you're in the area. Plenty of great food elsewhere in KL. but if you must have air conditioning, this is a decent choice."
0,Tyler L.,Lot 10 Hutong,"This is a food court located in the basement of the Lot 10 shopping mall (right next to the Bukit Bintang Monorail stop). It is cheaper than the other food courts but this one has way less variety. There are no Western foods offered here at all. Almost all the stalls were different kinds of Chinese food - Shanghainese, Cantonese, congee, pastries, fried chicken, bubble tea, etc. We ended up choosing a ""Thai"" stall, but the food was not authentic at all. Besides the flavors being off, they were very stingy on the meat. And besides that, the meat was old. The beef in my curry was super hard and very difficult to chew."
0,Pei M.,Lot 10 Hutong,"I loved the pork belly soup! it's a must try~ the jap supermarket is adjacent to it, try the red bean maji!"
0,Clarence J.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Below the Lot 10 Shopping Center is a wonderfully unique hawker center that brings a street food street indoors.  A wealth of Asian street food is served from numerous stalls, which you wander among on narrow paths between stalls and tables.  Pleasantly steamy, bustling with people from various cultures, noisy with cooking sounds and conversations in multiple languages, and with (mostly...) wonderful smells all around you, the Underground is an excellent experience.  Except for times when I have tried something that just did not suit my preferred tastes, I have thoroughly enjoyed the dishes I have had here.  For what it is worth, my favorite so far is the Ipoh curry from a stall part-way up the stairs on the south end of the area.  (It is across from Hei Heng, but I unfortunately cannot t tell what the name is exactly.)  One note: You will likely need to buy food and drinks separately -- most stalls only serve food, while a few focus on drinks.

You can reach the Underground via the street-level escalator off of Jalan Bukit Bintang -- just look for the cluster of Chinese-language signs hanging above and nearby an escalator dropping below -- via stairs near the Lot 10 entrance on Jalan Sultan Ismail, or via escalator from inside Isetan.  I have only been here for dinner so I cannot speak about how crowded it may be at lunch, but you can usually find tables at dinner time.  On occasion, for larger groups that want to eat together, it might benefit you to find a table first and then send people off to buy food instead of counting on finding one of the large tables free after everyone buys their meals.

If you are not up for the street food, Isetan's Japanese market is connected, with its collection of Japanese food and drinks (including excellent tasting stands for sake, beer, whiskey, and wine!)."
0,Tim X.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Food was the highlight of my visit to Kuala Lumpur, and in that spirit, my friend and I planned an entire evening around Lot 10 Hutong. A food court tucked away in the bottom of a mall? I'm there. We had three meals there in the span of an hour and a half: eat, wander and research, repeat.

We were referred here by locals who cited its extreme popularity, but luckily it did not feel crowded and the lines were never too long at each individual place. There is a huge variety of vendors, including barbecue, noodle, Malaysian, Chinese-Malaysian, Japanese, dessert, drinks, and more.

Everything is very reasonably priced and delicious. Highly recommend!"
0,Ronnie S.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Always a great meal to be had here! I like the Hokkien Mee, but the opportunity for a great experience here is unlike many others. I always finish up at Huckleberry in the Japan Store. Quality beyond expectations!"
0,Earng B.,Lot 10 Hutong,Must try Hokkien Mee. It's scrumptious. I like it. Every time I come to Pavillion will walk  cross the road here at Lot10 to eat this Hokkien Mee
0,Brian S.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Lot 10 Hutong is a food court located in the basement of a department store in a mall in central Kuala Lumpur. It features about a dozen different restaurants representing many famous Malaysian dishes. While this food court doesn't have the absolute best food in the country or even city, it is certainly a diverse collection of really good restaurants all under one roof.

We tried dishes from about four of the stands, and we enjoyed all of them. The prices are reasonable (not as cheap as street food, but cheaper than many restaurants), and the seating area is pleasant. There are clean bathrooms and good air conditioning. The metro is only about a 5 minute walk away.  

Bottom line: if you are only in KL for a short time and want to try many different Malaysian dishes, this is a great place to do it."
0,Jasmine Y.,Lot 10 Hutong,"A food court that's owned by one person who decided to pull all the good vendors into one place? It sounds enticing but I was a bit skeptical. The place is located inside an older mall so there weren't many customers in the actual mall.
The food court however was filled with people and there were plenty of stalls to choose from. A lot of them were Chinese though so nothing too local in my opinion. I had wanted to get duck rice from the outside vendors and they had it in the food court so I just decided to get it there. It was good but nothing special. I didn't enjoy the fact that I could get duck neck with my meal though. The portion was also a good size.
My cousin also got us a wok stir fried dark sauce noodle that tasted really good. They come around with a drink and dessert cart. The drinks aren't cold so you need to ask for ice."
0,Suria N.,Lot 10 Hutong,"We dined here and had a rice dish with honey pork barbecue, roast duck, and roast pork, to share. Also a bowl of ABC (sic!) soup, and a bowl of Mee Pok or pork noodles and a bowl of fish balls. Basically it's a food court with the night market atmosphere. Very interesting. Well, the foods just okay but I love the atmosphere where we could watch people walking indecisively."
0,Jon L.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Hutong is located on the lower ground floor of Lot 10. When you enter via the street entrance, it doesn't seem obvious that this is a food court. Usually food courts are pretty straightforward with rows of food stalls. Here the food stalls are structured like a maze. And since it is on the lower ground level, this spot feels very cavernous.

Hutong is a different type of food court than the ones you see at other shopping malls in KL. That is because it consists of over 30 vendors which are all heritage brands. What this means that each eatery has a history dating back at least 40 years and has instant name recognition. Since these vendors have a long history in business, you know that the food here has to be pretty good and has been vetted for quality to be part of this ""best of"" food court.

All of the food vendors are Asian brands. The food offered here seemed to be primarily Chinese and Malaysian. Though there is Korean and Thai food available. Not all of the food stalls are eateries though. There are a few desserts, juice bars and snack places here.

The pricing seems to be a little bit higher than you might pay at other places. But I think it is worth the price because this is an indoor food court with air conditioning and plenty of seating.  And because the heritage brands here are among the best in what they have to offer."
0,M M.,Lot 10 Hutong,It is a food court at the basement of the mall.  The variety and prices are pretty good.  Food was so so.  It is your normal food court food.
0,Karine K.,Lot 10 Hutong,"One of the best food places we have found.
Definitely better and cleaner than Jalan Alor street food.
Lots of options of Asian food, alcohol too. Clean bathroom !"

0,Maria M.,Lot 10 Hutong,"Our favorite brunch at KL, it's under ground level, full of meals to choice from, we always have brunch here everytime we come to visit KL"
0,Jasmine C.,Lot 10 Hutong,"3.5 stars based on this experience. I have heard a lot about this particular food court as it's said to be where all the tried and tested hawker stalls are invited to come under one roof by YTL. Quite a noble intention as it also makes life easier for tourists who want to try the ""best"" but can't quite locate the stalls at their various locations. And it's also because I have guests staying around here that we ended up here.

As it's really a food court, prices are of course more expensive than the actual stalls, but when you think of it, we humans don't mind paying for convenience and the air-conditioning. It's a bit of a maze getting around inside, but I think that embodies the term hutong perfectly. Narrow streets and alleys etc. We only had time to try a couple of items, so I went for the Penang Char Kway Teow and Macau Pork Bun (I think this is the last remaining shop of the franchise as I don't spot them around town anymore).

The wait for the CKT is not too long as there are two young guys frying away. The CKT is quite decent, full of wok hei (smoky) but couldn't really tell the difference between the duck egg and normal chicken egg so I would say, save your RM2 and just have the normal one haha. The stall offers other Penang dishes like assam laksa, curry noodles, lor bak etc but we didn't try it.

The Macau Pork Chop Bun took a while to prepare as it's cooked upon order. But tastewise, it was average. I only used to frequent this chain for the milk tea and I am glad to say the hot milk tea is as good as I remembered.

Anyway, have to try more dishes here to give a fairer rating."
0,Intan N.,Marble 8,"I have been very fortunate to spend my birthday at one of KL's top fine-Marble 8 and it was an experience I will never forget!

This place is a fancy schmancy place with a strict dress code so I was ready to play that strong dress game! Dressing well is a good form of good manners am I right?! Anyway, the place was a bungalow turned restaurant in a strategic location in KL where you can see the Perronas twin towers and it is the perfect backdrop as you enjoy your meal. The interior is ver luxe and elegant, romantic dim lighting and has an upstairs lunge area to further enjoy your wine and cigars.

Moving on to the wondrous food, the real belle of the ball for me was the tomahawk steak! Marble 8 is well known for their steaks but the tomahawk steak is the cut above the rest, it is a huge bone-in rib cut steak with the bone intact that can be shared amongst 4-5 people, soft and tender, I can go on forever. Though pricey (rm2100) for 1.8 kilos to be exact but totally worth it."
0,Ben Y.,Marble 8,"It's one of those places where you go for the view and thankfully the foods not bad either.  

One word of advice though, you can't actually get an unobstructed view of BOTH towers.  The restaurant building is actually too close to the towers and the angle it's at only lets you see one tower and like half of the second one.  

4 stars for the whole package - food, ambience, service, view.  

3 stars for the food alone.  

We got the Bistecca steak for 2 and it was fine.  Supposedly top grade Australian Wagyu which to me is just good USDA Prime.   Places throw out the terms Wagyu and Kobe around a lot but in reality there's real Japanese A5 Wagyu and then there's everything else in a distant 2nd.  

The truffle fries were fine and the portebellos were fine.   In terms of food everything was ""fine.""  Average for a place of this cost.  

The steak, 2 sides, and a bottle of wine cost use around 350 USD which is relatively reasonable I guess.  

It's one of those places where you go for the view and thankfully the foods not bad either"
0,Clarence J.,Marble 8,"I was here for brunch and thought this was good but not what I'd hoped.  The brunch spread was a good-size, although I perhaps greedily expected more for the price.  There was a table of salads/vegetables/fruits, carved meat (roast beef), and breads; a table with three entrees in chafing dishes; and a dessert table.  In addition, the staff brings around small-bite items and bowls of pasta.  The food was good, but I didn't come across anything that wowed me and made me go back for more.  (Not that that stopped me from going back for more, especially because I'm a sucker for pasta.)  You can choose all-you-can-drink options with prosecco, wine...and maybe beer?

The brunch is served in a beautiful setting, with elegant, dark shades indoors that highlight the excellent view of KLCC Park and the Petronas Towers through the floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides of the restaurant.  The staff is friendly and efficient."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Marble 8,"Coming here for a F1 pre-party, marble 8 was a statement of class and luxury.

Slightly different from other restaurants or bars that might call themselves the luxury outlets, this place actually have their staff properly trained as well that you will not be having unpleasant experience while you're there.

I was in the guest list for the party while there's a cover charge for those walking in, which is a charge of rm99++

The place actually has steakhouse, bar and PRIVE. The bar is very comfortable and you don't feel too cramped up, and there's a small dance floor area in front of the dj stage.

Outside there's this patio area with seats as well. With good view of the bright klcc at night, it's a very nice place to chill and catch up with friends.

For their bar they do serve a very wide range of beverages from beer to wine, cocktails to mocktails and more.

For such a nice ambience i would say that the price list is rather fair. Also, they have happy hours from 6-9 which the happy hours rates are actually very good.

Parking is free in the building's compound here and usually it's not a problem to get a spot here unless you're coming a little late.

Overall, nice environment, very suitable for events as well, great service, fair price - definitely coming back again."
0,Kim A.,Marble 8,"We enjoyed a very nice view and a great dinner and even better service. After a mishap with the hostess at the beginning of the evening, we were very glad we stayed for the dinner. Management handled the mishap very professionally. The steak and sides were the best we have had on our two week holiday."
0,Patience G.,Marble 8,"The very best steaks in the city! My favourite of all time is the dry-aged bone in tenderloin, followed by rib-eye and tomahawk. Oh yes not forgetting the sundries tomato pasta and grilled soy sauce cod fish! I love job as I get to taste it first hand!"
0,Julie Y.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has been making waves in the KL fine dining scene as its well known for their steaks. You know this place means business when they require you to pay a deposit if you make a reservation and there is also a minimum order as well. So bring your wad of cash and be prepared to spend quite a bit here.

The restaurant is located in its own compound so there is limited complimentary parking available for diners. The stunning view of the twin towers is part of the highlight at Marble 8. Besides the restaurant, there's also a bar and prive set up for guests who want to lounge around.

A window showcasing the room where the meats are dried is also another fascinating feature you'll find at Marble 8. Though the place is known for their steaks i opted for their lobster instead as I was cutting back on meat. My dish did not disappoint but I was sorely tempted by the steak which warrants a second visit."
0,Nicole S.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 is a fancy smansy bar located in the heart of KL. It has an amazing view but doesn't beat Marini's mainly because its not on the 57th floor but on the ground floor so you have to look up for your view of the city skyline. The drinks here are so-so. I had the screwdriver and didn't like it one bit. However friends who had the pina colada said it was very good.

The atmosphere outside is very pretty because there are a lot of plants and hedges. However, if it happens to start raining, you have no shelter and so have to move back inside. This place has a really cool DJ console,Its elevated pretty high and gives the DJ a good view of the crowd and vice versa. The cocktails go for about RM30 which is pretty pricey for the quality that you get. The only reason i would come back here is because of the gorgeous view."
0,Khalisah K.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has a trio venue with different offerings which consists of elegance. Their premium steakhouse, modern chic bar, and elegant privé. I've only managed to make my way to the M8 bar recently and i was very impressed. It was ultra-stylish and simple at the same time and that made it spectacular. M8 has been conceptualized as Kuala Lumpur's bar destination for its sophistication and elegance.

My favorite part of M8, is of course the al-fresco area, the view of the Twin Towers is so stunning. M8 bar's prices are very reasonable for what it is. I mean come on, you're hanging out with your friends, drinking, good music and a breathtaking view. What more could you ask for?!"
0,Arild H.,Marble 8,"Marble 8 has closed the restaurant in Lorong Kuda/Binjai and moved to Petronas tower 3 level 56, opening 2 week of April 17"
0,Dennis D.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"Malaysia Boleh! I love Kuala Lumpur! This is one of my favorite kopi tiam's in the town. I've been here many times, since I was a child. This place has gone through generation after generation- even my PohPoh came here a lot way back in the day (it's been around since 1956). The general area is kind of touristy because it's located near Central Market and Petaling Street (get you a nice fake LV and Rolex, if you want), but this particular place is mainly Malaysians.

Beef noodles are the #1 thing here. You can get tendon, meatball, organs, brisket, anything of your choosing. Seating is challenging. It's really popular among locals, so you might have to stand around and wait. BUT I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Would you want to fly all the way to this beautiful country and only be able to tell your friends you ate 'tourist food?' Check this place out.

One thing to keep in mind, when visiting KL in this part, the area is notorious for motorcycle theft. Meaning, some dude might try to run up and snatch your purse or chain and take off on his buddy's getaway bike. It's not by any means a terribly dangerous area, but just be a little extra careful, because low-life scum try to prey on unsuspecting tourists in all countries. Now with that being said, is it worth risking a precious belonging over some beef noodles? The answer is a resounding YES. Eat, lah!"
0,David S.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"It seems as if when you cross the border into Malaysia the nature of the restaurants change dramatically, at least with regards to the hawker variety. This is basically one such place where you have four stalls inside the room, each of them selling their own product. So, you might get your meal from one stall, and a beer from another. Mind you, this place was pretty cool, especially since the entire place erupted in cheers when I purchased as tiger beer. I guess they were impressed that some Anglo was willing to drink the local fair as opposed to the ubiquitous Heiniken. Then again, I do try to avoid Heiniken."
0,T. H. S.,Lai Foong Restaurant,"First thing first: you can get almost anything here at Lai Foong! Noodles of all kinds, dry or soup, fried rice, chicken rice, char siew, siew yok, wantan mee, porridge, beef noodle, pork noodle, dim sum, hakka luei cha (veggie mix), freshly-baked tarts, cookies and buns, siewpao, kaya kok, even western breakfast! Every old-time delicates, you'll find them here. The hard part? Choosing what to eat. It's an old-time chinese restaurant with a very rich cultural surrounding, in the middle of the busy KL city centre. Everytime I come here, it's so crowded to the sense that people are pushing each other around. Sometimes waiters are having a hard time to walk pass the crowd. The food is definitely a cause of it. It's super hot inside though. Then again, that's the essence, experiencing the heat and liveliness of the oldtown. Also, it's very close to Petaling Street. One minute walking distance. *recommended*"
0,Weinye C.,Restaurant Siu Siu,"Honestly, I personally know the owners of this place and I'm not writing a review because of that. I'm writing this because I feel this place doesn't get enough attention as they should!

I've frequent this branch and the original one (near Mid Valley) many times before. The menu would most likely have all the common items that you would find in a Chinese restaurant but they have some specialties that are worth mentioning. Just ask for a recommendation and they will give you some of the popular and favourite items on the menu.

Eventhough everything is good, their specialties are the river fishes and char siew (only limited quantities each day). I've introduced this place to my friends who live in Damansara that would drive to KL just to have char siew here and to tapau some home for later. I would say, best is to call ahead just to check if the char siew is still available if you're planning to try it out.

This place is huge with indoor (there's a small section with AC and the rest is with fan) and outdoor gazebo seating. So it's a good place to host big gatherings, office or family dinners. There's also a huge stage (with mics and speakers etc) in the restaurant so if you're thinking of hosting a big birthday party or anniversary dinner, you may use the stage for your get together as well. It also has a huge (free) parking lot upfront with a parking attendant.

So, if you're around KL and would like to have some seafood or Chinese food and not want to deal with looking for a parking spot and is away from all the busy streets, crowds and tight spaces, I'd recommend for you to try this place out :)"
0,Lori A.,The Canteen Room,"Im a very picky eater,but they have some awesome food. They have many many things to choose from. The juices and coffee is the bomb . They have very fast service and very ...very nice. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Malaysia. It's very convenient to many other places.
I will definitely come back, when I am in Malaysia."
0,Yenny L.,Restoran Hung Kee,"Best charred char siew that I have had. Will definitely be back when I visit KL! We ordered more char siew after we ordered a plate of char siew and siew yok!
Every single piece tastes so good, salty and sweet. The charred part is da bomb!

The plate of kailan is also good. The stalk is soft and well cooked.

Noodle is just so so but you cannot miss the char siew for sure!"
0,Jane T.,Restoran Hung Kee,"1st try at this Restaurent. I got to know from a friend that it's famous for wan tan mee. Since I'm going to town might as well drop by to give it a try.

It's located at Jalan loke yew where some old looking bridal house were located. Parking here is quite troublesome as its along the road side or you have to drive behind the shop lots where the housing area is to park.

The shop has aircon and the typical coffee shop hot and stuffy area. Of course I choose to sit in the cooling area;)

I ordered dry wan tan mee with char Siew . For me the wan tan mee is just okay, nothing to shout about. It's too salty, char Siew is just okay too as I had better char siews. The wan tan is the soup type, it's quite big in size and quite flavorful.

I ordered a side of Sai you fish ball soup. The small size come with 5 fish balls and some Veges. The soup is bland and the fish ball is also normal too. They too have other noodle dishes such as friend Cantonese mee, friend hokkien mee and so on.

Overall experience is just normal."
0,Wye Mun K.,Restoran Hung Kee,"One of the oldest restaurants around in KL. It's been around since the 1990's. Hung Kee is known for its awesome Char Siew and Wanton Mee. Apart from that, they serve dishes as well. One of the famous dishes they serve is their Steamed Ginger Fish.

The restaurant may look old and shabby but ignore its appearance as the food is definitely awesome!!

I've been eating there since I was young and even up till today the food is still good!! For those of you who are around KL, its a must go to place for awesome Char Siew and Wanton Mee.

They are open for lunch and dinner, i'm not so sure about breakfast."
0,Jocelyn W.,Restoran Hung Kee,"Won tun mee never goes wrong, the ""BBQ"" pork is amazing, if it's not recommended by friend, I won't pass by there."
0,Simina I.,Tarbush Restaurant,"I've been here once for a lunch with my team from work. We decided to try Moroccan food for the first time.

Once we arrived here, the staff guide us to the table and brought us the menu. It took us a while to decide what to order because we never had before this type of dish. But with the help of the friendly stuff we manage to order some delicious food. I have to say that I'm impressed with the Moroccan food: meat...salads...drinks...everything was perfect.

The interior design of the place is very nice, in Moroccan style...the staff has traditional Moroccan outfits. The place is perfect for meetings because is not noise and you can also go here for a date because the red colour of the walls, gives a romantic touch.

In regards to the price, I can't say anything because the company payed for us, so I haven't seen the bill.

P.S. In case that you want to go here with a big group, I recommend you to make a reservation."
0,Ronnie S.,Tarbush Restaurant,Great example of Middle Eastern fare. This place really has some great food service habits. Great food served by a large talented staff. I recommend this place over a few other good restaurants just because of their discipline in service.
0,Ahmed D.,Tarbush Restaurant,"This restaurant is one of the best in Malaysia.. its a Lebanese which serve Arabic cuisines in its original form & taste.. We had a great time & the view from the balcony to the busy street nearby is awesome.
Absolutely recommending it to anyone who likes arabic foods or want to try it in Malaysia especially in Bukit Bintang. The prices compared to the delicious foods is really acceptable."
0,Alexandra M.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Looking for a Middle Eastern Restaurant in Malaysia? Here you have it.

They use fresh and really great quality ingredients which makes the food very delicious. The interior decor is really authentic and really makes you want to take a quick trip to Morocco. The dishes are really delicious and their menu has a large variety to pick from.

If you stop by you have to try one of their Shish Kebabs. They are amazing. The service is good and the ambiance is very welcoming and inviting."
0,Brighthoney W.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Great Arabic salads, good meat dishes. I don't know why people raved about the Baclava, it tasted like something that sat in the fridge for too long.
Great for tourists and people curious about Middle eastern cuisine."
0,Lucie B.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Tarbush is a fantastic middle eastern restaurant providing delicious, authentic food full of flavor!
The arabic salad, lamb flat bread and shish tawouk are stand outs. Could eat at this delicious place every day!"
0,Nicole S.,Tarbush Restaurant,"Tarbush serves middle eastern food such as briyani, shish kebab, shawarma etc. Its definitely 100% without a doubt my favorite middle eastern restaurant simply because the food is delicious. The ambiance is nothing to shout about, i mean there are some camels on the wall and the whole place sorta looks like a desert. They make really good garlic dip to pairs perfectly with the lamb cubes or shish tawook.  

Prices are a little expensive but the food is consistent and you can be sure to be only served the best. I would recommend the chicken and lamb briyani, the lamb cubes and the mixed grill which consist of lamb chops, shish kebab and shish tawook. Once you eat at Tarbush, trust me you'd never wanna have middle eastern food anywhere else."
0,Sara M.,Tarbush Restaurant,"This place is absolutely epic! You have amazingly tasty middle easter food! the place is located on the top flour of BSC. I went there for a team lunch and we ordered like a family menu and we had all these different options laid out for us! it was beautiful and tasty!

I loved the baklava and the Moroccan tea! they also had some moroccan dishes which can blow your mind! Don't hesitate to give this place a try! it's over priced but it's so worth it!!"
0,Shoaib D.,Tarbush Restaurant,Great food. It's the place for the kebab eaters to visit. Highly recommended. I also tried the Halabiya (the pudding with milk cream?) and tasted awesome. This is a bit expensive by KL standards.
0,Robert S.,Shawarma Damascus,"This place seems to be quite a popular shawarma place in Bukit Bintang. This particular location is new and not too far from the old place. Somewhat is more accessible I think.

The shop always have customers, so the grill is always on and the meats kept being shaved (which equates to juicy meats). We had a chicken shawarma, and thought the chicken was well seasoned and flavored. The veggies are okay.

Prices are reasonably low. Many items are less than MYR10. You may dine in, take out, or in our case, just eat your sandwich at the curb. The meats portion is not as generous as the one that I usually get in the States, but then again the price is only at a fraction that we usually pay at the States.

I would definitely come back when in the area. I would definitely also pay more for the extra meats."
0,T F.,Shawarma Damascus,The best Shawarma in town. I did try both Chicken and Beef shawarma Great food and price is cheap for Reg roll only 6.00 RM.
0,pete e.,Shawarma Damascus,The Shawarma is the best I had out of Damascus. I enjoyed the beef flavor the most. It was easy to find. Quick service and felt like it was the thing I was looking for
0,Jorensylv N.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Love this Arabic restaurant to bits...! Their food standard is high in terms of taste and variation. Nothing compares to the bread they make here, and I mean it! It really depends on the chef's mood, if not in the mood, the chef makes it still nice, but not as good. There are many times when the bread tastes magical! You may request for the chef to cook the bread a little longer to make it crispier.

The dishes to die for here are the chicken and mutton Ogda (served in hot black stone bowl)!! Their taste might be something U've never tried before. The meat was shredded very finely , it almost looks like beaten eggs. I believe the meat in these 2 dishes have been set in oven overnight at a relatively low temperature, allowing the heat to soften the meat. This method might also the reason as to why their mutton doesn't have that 'stinky' mutton smell. This is the first time in my life taking so much mutton, I usually hate the smell of mutton, but this, love it.

As for their kebab, I wouldnt say it ranks in the top for their restaurant. Chicken kebab wasn't really cooked thoroughly with some parts in pink, beef kebab proved a little too tough as well, but taste is quite nice. There's not much taste to the fish kebab either except for the salt haha. Love their homemade garlic mayonnaise, great to go with fries!

If u're looking at juices, I recommend the grape juice as it's freshly pressed, all natural! All goodness in a cup, mango juice wise, they mix it with puree and mango meat. Not too bad.

Service wise, the waiters were really helpful and friendly. Overall, this my if my favourite Arabic restaurant here in Kuala Lumpor, and it's known to serve great food! Sometimes rumours can't go too wrong ;)"
0,Clarence J.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Wadi Hawdramawt is a good-sized place sitting behind a car lot on Jalan Ampang.  The airy downstairs and upstairs dining rooms have plenty of seating at tables of all sizes, and there are at least a few tables in a covered outdoors area as well.

The food from the large menu and is very good all around, cooked beautifully and with wonderful spices.  The standout to me is always the rice, which is one of the top one or two rices I have had around Kuala Lumpur (with the other being Chen-Chen Goose & Duck in Pudu).  Other than the rice though, I have been able to try many things on the wonderful menu and have not felt that I have made a bad choice yet."
0,Tina M.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"Best Arabic in KL, went back two more times on our trip. Had the lamb and chicken and it was delicious. Had lentil soup and it was great. Hummus with lamb was amazing. I miss the food here!"
0,William D.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"This is my pick for the best Arabic food in KL.  It took me a few years to finally go in to have a meal because it is in a very unassuming spot for such great food.  Who would have thought to look for a fine dining experience sandwiched in between to car dealerships on a pretty ugly stretch of Jalan Ampang?  Make no mistake, this place is great.  

The bread here is epic.  It is fresh, flavorful, pulls apart beautifully for dipping and wrapping, but most of all it is huge :) This bread alone is worth the trip.  I love that they have one specific baker for the bread and if he is not in there is no bread.  Complete quality control.

My second favorite this here is called Ogda chicken.  It also come in a lamb version.  It is slowly cooked chicken that melts in your mouth and has just the right amount of spice.  Wrap a piece of their bread around a bite of this and you will see why I am raving about it so much.  

I also like the Moroccan soup and the mint tea they serve.  The service is good too.  I have always found the staff super friendly and accommodating."
0,Joanna H.,Retoran Wadi Hadramawt,"My family loves this restaurant.  The food is good and the staff is friendly.  We love the humus with huge Arabic bread, the Mandy, the mixed barbecue...much more.  Go there, you'll love it, too!"
0,Sandy L.,Lai Po Heen,"I came here with my family for their Chinese New Year dinner menu.
The feast started off with Yee Sang but we requested for fruits instead of raw salmon, and they gave us fresh pear slices which were good too.

They cooked each dish very delicately and all with fresh ingredients, cooked till just right. I liked the stir fried prawns with coconut sauce and steamed fish. The waiters were really helpful that they attended all our requests politely and assisted us in serving the dishes in individual plates.

We could watch the chefs cooking through the glass partition and they nodded and smiled at us as if we're welcomed by them too.

I would love to try their dim sum menu some day!"
0,Vanessa O.,Lai Po Heen,"Definitely one of the most expensive Chinese Meal I've ever had in my life. Fortunately, I was here for a corporate meal which didn't cost me a single penny! I'm not used to this pampering lifestyle but was luckily to be part of this lunch. Food here is simply fantastic. Once you dine here, you will understand what does fine dining (Chinese) truly means.

The service was excellent and the waiters / waitresses were extreme attentive to your needs. Tea was constantly filled up whenever it reaches to the middle of your tiny tea cups. Food quality was nice but the portion was slightly small... nonetheless enough for us to have our tummies filled for a lunch.

Each serving was served in a timely manner where there is not much waiting in between - simply fantastic."
0,Shaun K.,Lai Po Heen,"Duck is good.
They carved it in front of you.

Food and service is 5 star standard.

Strict timing on opening times.

Selective seating.

Bias towards white sometimes.

Tea is expensive"
0,Wye Mun K.,Lai Po Heen,"Looking for a hotel with a great Chinese Restaurant? Head over to Lai Po Heen in Mandarin Oriental! They won multiple awards for their food and they have renown chefs cooking your food so don't worry, you'll definitely be satisfied even for the price you pay.

I've been here a couple of times and I never was disappointed. Great service, great food and of course the price is kinda ""great"" as well. I'm not sure if they still serve their Honeydew Chicken but if they still do, you gotta try it. Food is fresh and flavourful of course, definitely a great place to go to if you're willing to pay the price!"
0,Jean-Luc D.,Lai Po Heen,Excellent food! I am usually not fond of chinese food but I found the food served in this restaurant more than excellent. We were a party of 15 and were served in a private room.
0,Sue W.,Lai Po Heen,"Was here for our CNY reunion dinner on Sunday and as always, Lai Poh Heen delivered! Food and service was good - which is why we return year after year. We had a customised set menu which started with yee sang and ended with jelly for dessert. Service staff is so very trained - more than a dozen were foreigners and they took the effort to recite the ""blessings"" before and while serving the yee sang. Shows how much effort Mandarin puts into staff training. Only let down was the ""missing"" steamed garoupa - it was mistakenly sent to another table by which time, we didn't have much of a mood to eat. They did offer us a dim sum lunch replacement or a rebate on the bill. So that was thoughtful of them - actually they even gave us the fish to take home since it was already made (a new fish) before the message was passed to the kitchen."
0,Aris L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"One of my favorite restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. I ordered siew yok (roast pork), barbecue pork, and the roast chicken with hainanese chicken rice. It tastes really good. I will definitely comeback to this restaurant again..

CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!! MUST TRY!!"
0,Mindy D.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"The roast pork here is like crack! So crispy that you can hear the crackling with every bite. Skip the chicken cause it's all about the siew yuk here. The meats are served with fragrant rice cooked in chicken broth and other flavorings. So simple yet so delicious!

Don't expect the best service here... Actually, the service was terrible. They are super busy and could care less if you get served. You have to fend for yourself. The tables are open seating, but you gotta order at the counter first. Learn from me and don't sit there for 15 minutes and wait for a server to approach you. There's no systematic way of ordering because you literally just yell your order to the lady who's also running around the restaurant. The menu is all in Chinese... good luck, friends. Cash only."

0,Hiroki K.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"Very nice taste, in particular, sauce is the secret of the magic. Enjoy chicken rice with pork!"
0,Carolyn L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"The sio bak (or siew yoke or roast pork belly) is to die for here! Thin crispy crackling skin with juicy tender meat.

I am not a big fan of pork and when friends hear me wax lyrical on the sio bak here, they know it is a ""die die must try place"".

I have been here twice in 2 years and the quality remains consistent for me.

The roast chicken is nice but nothing outstanding. The char siew is slightly better as it has a honeyed taste or maybe it is molasses sweetened. Maybe if you could request for the fatty char siew (we didn't ask so not sure if they would accommodate the request), then it would be better. Our plate of char siew is a mix of lean and fatty meat. My friends definitely prefer the fatty bits.

I had heard about the long queues from my Malaysian friends who introduced me to this place and was told to get there before 12pm. On Friday (and possibly most weekdays), it was already crowded and hard pressed to find an empty table. There would also be a line forming. The line is for ""takeaways"", so just go straight to a table if you are dining in. Saturday was much better though the tables were mostly filled up by 1230pm.

The staff will go around taking your order. Then you wait and wait and wait till 1230pm when the master chef will appear and start chopping the luscious roast meat.

The price is on the high side for sio bak (RM16 per strip) but it is because they give you the best part of the meat. The odds and ends are not served to customers so all get the center parts of the sio bak. This place is quite old school and you can help yourself to the soup from the gigantic pot at the side of the coffee shop.

The rice served is chicken rice so it gives an additional fragrance and taste to the meat.

I am just thankful I don't live in KL otherwise I can see myself coming here very often.

Note:
1, It is closed on Sunday.

2. Do yourself a favor and order a strip of sio bak for each person so that there is no fighting. The portion for 1 is not very big anyway.

3. Get the MyTeksi App if you do not drive as it can be hard to flag down a cab there. Also prepare your GPS map as not all taxi drivers know this place, the GPS will help direct the taxi driver and tell the driver it is near Times Square or the old Pudu jail area."
0,Hobart L.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"Don't waste your time on their chicken rice and char siew. There are way better options elsewhere. In my mind, there's only one thing worth getting here, and it's their siew yoke. Crispy skin that crackles easily when you bite into it, followed by this spot-on ratio of fat to meat that melts in your mouth. Sure, there are times when it is quite a let down (meat was too chewy for e.g. last week), but Wong Kee at its best produces the perfect siew yoke that's almost heavenly. Until I find a better place, this is where I keep coming back week after week.

Probably more of a 4.5 stars to 4 given recent disappointments, but like I said, at its best, there is no better siew yoke.

Note: Come during weekends as there is less of a crowd. It only starts serving siew yoke at 12.30pm sharp, but people start flowing in around 12pm. No need to come too early on weekends, but make sure you come before 1.30-2pm because that's usually when it sells out."
0,Benjamin T.,Restaurant Wong Kee,"I've been here many times and each time the Siew Yuk makes me speechless. The crispy skin and melt in your mouth pork makes it one of the best if not the best Siew Yuk in KL in my opinion. I actually like their chicken as well, well cooked and marinated. Not as good as the Siew Yuk of course, but is definitely a compliment to a hearty meal."
0,Jason T.,Restaurant Wong Kee,Best in town roasted pork (siu yoke). Despite my family in similar business and countless tasting of roasted pork. I still yet to find a match. Try it yourself. Make sure you are here by 12.30pm for seats and u will need to wait till 1pm for the food. Usually everything will be sold out within an hour of their business starts

0,Yi En N.,Breakfast Thieves,The price is high. The food so so though special and creative. The drink is quite special and great.
0,Trena M.,Breakfast Thieves,"Situated right next to Pulp, Breakfast Thieves is the newest hipster spot in Bangsar. Not only is the food trendy (with descriptions like sesame shards, perfumed strawberry, chocolate soil, etc), but the waiters come with attitude (not the good kind).

The coffee is on point, and Pulp will definitely be facing some fierce competition. For food, we ordered the French toast, yogurt parfait and salmon with polenta. All delicious, but the portions are ridiculously small and the food is a bit high maintenance. The place gives off that vibe as soon as you walk in though, and I expected no less. Overall, I prefer a place with less frills that doesn't leave me hungry."
0,abu h.,Breakfast Thieves,"Excellent place. The atmosphere is really cool. The service was great and the food was superb. We had the legend (must try), terry Benedict (pretty good), and breakfast chain (excellent)"
0,Sandy L.,Inner Mongolian Steamboat,"This restaurant is located among several shoplots with plenty of Chinese cuisine (such as Hunan, Sichuan, etc). We ordered the roast lamb leg (that requires one day reservation ahead), mongolian milk tea that tastes slightly salty and clear, steamboat with double soups (one 清汤 - herbal clear soup and one 麻辣 - spicy).

We enjoy the variety of dumplings both pan fried or soup boiled, which were so fresh and taste was flavourful. A friend even order more frozen dumplings for takeaway to bring home.

The restaurant isn't always full, but it does take them some time to prepare and serve the food."
0,Mickey L.,1919 Restaurant,"An all-around really pleasant meal to wrap up my visit to Kuala Lumpur. The wait staff were friendly, polite, and extremely helpful, telling us (the unacquainted diners in the realm of Nyonya cuisine) where the good food was.

We ordered four small dishes for two people, and every single dish nailed the spot. The fried Philippine eggplant recommended by our server was cut and fried just like French fries (but tasted better because it was eggplant inside)! The ostrich meat, which I've never tried before, was delicious when cooked teppanyaki style. The nyonya fried rice tasted a little spicy and contained different seasonings that I hadn't tasted before, but every bite of it was enjoyable. Lastly, the mixed vegetables with tofu provided superb balance to our meal, and the homemade tofu stood out for its soft texture and delightful flavor.

What a fantastic and unusual meal - strongly recommend to both locals and tourists alike."
0,Kamal K.,1919 Restaurant,"A good feel of Baba Nyonya cuisine although the service could use more help. Came here for lunch with a group for something different away from KLCC where we work.  A bit too close for a taxi ride but a bit too far for a walk. The taxi vote won.
When we stepped in, we saw a charming restaurant with a traditional feel in decoration and furnishing.  
Service was slow and we weren't attended to for about 15 minutes after being handed the menu.  From the looks of it their wait staff was undermanned.
Luckily that was the only downside.  
Food arrived quickly and all the dishes were tasty.  Our original order for a deep fried garoupa siam style was not available after we checked on our remaining order and was replaced with fish head curry.  A good alternative but it would have helped to be informed earlier.
In the end a stomach well filled, with authentic cooking that makes you want to order everything on the menu just to have a taste. When you have a craving for home cooked style food you won't be disappointed here."
0,Johnny T.,1919 Restaurant,"When I first arrived here, the place is a little dodgy but the place looks very well decorated. One of the little treasures you find in KL. I came here for my friend's birthday as he likes chinese food very much. This place is more to nyonya kind of Chinese food. I was quite impressed by this place, the decoration have some antique furniture, mostly wooden tables and some marble tables, has that very old phone ringing. Makes it feel like an old nyonya house feel.
  The food is not bad, their dishes really well cooked in terms of th I like their Sweet & Sour fried fish, their salted egg fried chicken is also good. Just that this kind of place is a little more pricey than your usual chinese restaurants. Sotong is more pricey as usual. You can actually park around the restaurant but quite limited. You must slow down after passing Ambank tower because you can easily missed this place. But overall the food here not bad, pricey but not bad."
0,Peter D.,Al-Siddiq Express,"Personal Life Rules:

1. If you see a large amount of layered, spiced meat rotating on a spit, you should stop and see if you can get some.

2. If there also happens to be a line of people waiting to buy said meat, you should get on line immediately.

3. If your wife says you shouldn't buy the meat, well, now you're basically obligated to get two. It's the principle of the thing.

All three of these life rules intersected at Al-Siddiq, and resulted in me eating the most delicious chicken shawarma that ever existed for the equivalent of about $1.50 (American). My only regret is that I second-guessed myself with regard to Rule 3, and only purchased one of the fantastical shawarma wraps.

At least now I have confirmation that my wife is always, always wrong."
0,Sara M.,Bumbu Desa,"I have never tried Indonesian cuisine before but I have heard so much about it so I couldn't wait to visit this place. I had an amazing experience, my roommate who just came from Bali suggested that we go for this restaurant so he can show me how amazing the food is! and I was mind blown, they have such a tricky way and combinations that make their meals so delicious! you try it once and you will want it again!

It reminded me a lot of a restaurant I've been to when I was in Penang. Not to mention Penang has amazing food options as well."
0,Michael C.,Bumbu Desa,"I had never had Indonesian food so I decided to eat here. Location is great. Right inside the Petronas Towers. They had everything prepared and in plastic so you could get a sense of what you'd be ordering. I can't remember the names of the food I ordered but it was pretty good. Having just flown to Malaysia from Thailand I was expecting a bit more flavor and spice. That being said, I was satisfied with my meal overall. I got a combo meal as well as an al a carte item. The décor was beautiful and there were not very many people in the place so the food came out pretty quick. The drinks were the most interesting part of the meal. ""Weird"" but in a good way. Both drinks had different types of jellies in them which made for a unique experience. I'm glad I went in and tried this place. I would recommend it for any of the foodies out there looking for new and exciting food/flavors.

Not so humbly submitted,
King Michael C."
0,Julian T.,Hup Kee Seafood,"A local chinese restaurant here in Jalan Ipoh that serves dishes and rice. I usually visit with my family as only my parents know how to order all the best chinese dishes. The place is a little easy to miss, but just look out for a school and it's right beside.

Their most known and signature dish would be the Deep Fried Fish in Soy Sauce, which I would suggest it to anyone who visits. Another delicious dish to have is the Deep Fried Sweet Potato Prawns, which is a platter of prawns deep fried with cut sweet potatoes and served with chilli sauce. Amazing. The Yin Yang Pork Ribs is also a must try, which are pork ribs marinated in two different sauces, mayonaise and marmite which explains the Yin Yang (black and white).

The serving speed here is exceptionally fast, so you don't have to wait long with your hungry stomachs. On certain nights, a bowl of soup is served before each meal, which is kind of a nice appetizer and at the end of the meal, a plate of jellys and watermelons are served for desert.

You might hear a lot of shouting when it gets busy, I guess that's how they roll here."
0,Ben K.,Sambal Hijau,"Amazing, amazing Malay food - whenever I'm visiting KL, I make it a point to detour to this place.  It's a bit of a hike from the city center, but once you're here (if you can find it), it's so worth it.  Everything is delicious and the a la carte items always impress me.  I'll usually do one round of the buffet line, getting a little bit of everything, and then get an order of ikan bakar (sambal stingray).  I've had the stingray three times already, and every time it was just perfect.  As for the buffet, the namesake is one of the highlights - the green sambal is unlike what you'll find elsewhere and definitely packs a punch.  The rendang has such a strong flavor and it seems like the meat has been slow-cooked for days - yet it falls apart with just a fork.  All the veggies are usually crispy and flavorful, as well as the other meats and curries.  

I really eat too much whenever I'm here.  After you sit down with a massive plate of food, a staff member comes by and totals you up - you literally cannot eat 30rm worth of food, and I challenge you to do so.  The teh tarik is not as good as a place that specializes in it, but who cares. This place has some of the best Malay food I've ever had, a good selection of desserts, and a la carte barbeque choices.  Best time to come is mid morning or mid afternoon, because otherwise you WILL NOT get a seat.  

Come here with an empty stomach and thank me later."
0,John W.,Sambal Hijau,"- Food per person - meat + vegetable = RM 8. Decently priced.
- Food choices - great! (4.5/5) I've never seen Malay restaurants with these many choices.
- Atmosphere - crowded but with plenty of space in between.
- There seems to be a dedicated parking spot behind the restaurant
- the set up is modern, there is plenty of ventilation, and it's relatively clean and not sticky.
- The kampung/village area around the restaurant is a good example of traditional Malay living while close to the city area."
0,Sue F.,Sambal Hijau,"I love Sambal Hijau for the sheer variety of food they offer. Tray after tray of curries, veggies and meats are displayed, which makes for a unique lunch every time even if you frequent this place. I especially like the sambal tempe with ikan bilis, kuah daging manis and the various ulams. The marinated ikan bakar pari is quite a treat too.

At weekday lunch time, the space gets really crowded so I suggest you get there around 11 to guarantee yourself a seat. You run don't face the risk of the food running out. Parking too is a bit of a hassle, but with food this comforting, it's worth the trouble."
0,Nadhira S.,Sambal Hijau,"This is the best restaurant to get your Malay Rice Buffet (aka Nasi Campur). The wide range of dishes they put out during lunch is  massive! And if you're into Malay food, this is like the haven of Malay food. They have dishes from the different states in Malaysia and my favorite would have to be their Ayam Masak Cili Api which is a dish from Negeri Sembilan! (that's where my parents are from) If you come during lunch, be sure to reserve a spot first before you attack the Malay Rice buffet! I'm always satisfied every time I come here!"
0,Diana C.,Xin Cuisine,"The very first time I tried Dim Sum was in Xin, and I have to say it got me hooked!

Although I am alergic to shrimp (and this place is a death trap for someone with that condition), the shrimp-less options were delicious! The Pork Bun is absolutely fantastic! The restaurant is big and very nice, and the service is quite good, although I had trouble explaining that I could not eat shrimp.

The first time I went for lunch, the place was not full and we got a table right away. There was a Chinese musician playing, which was nice. The second time it was full and we had to wait in line for a while to get a table, but it didn't take that long.

The price is reasonable considering the quality of the food, but it might be a bit higher than other Dim Sum places. I recommend it and will definitely be coming back in the future!"
0,William D.,Xin Cuisine,"Xin Cuisine is my pick for the best dim sum in KL.  The price tag is not cheap compared with what the myriad of dim sum spots in KL but you get what you pay for.  The dim sum are all consistently awesome and they even have a traditional Chinese musician playing everyday.   The ambiance is perfect for a nice meal during the day.  

If you like pork their char siew Pau are delicious, as well as the king siew mai (go for the ""king"" Siew Mai if you like prawns!).  The bacon roll is also fantastic.  If you're not into pork or just want something lighter try the salted fish congee.  It is always cooked to perfection.  

This is a great place for a business lunch or groups of any size.  I highly recommend getting to Xin Cuisine if you are a dim sum fan!"
0,Welton B.,Xin Cuisine,"Went for the dim sum two days in a row. I loved the prawn dumplings, but the truly spectacular dish was the coconut buns. They were just ridiculously good. We hadn't planned on going two days in a row, but those buns were just too good. We also flipped over the ice cream mango sago. Basically, stop reading and go right now."
0,Scott E.,Restoran Win Heng Seng,"The Pork Noodle at Win Heng Seng along Jalam Imbi is a must try, the best Pork Noodle in KL!"
0,Mea T.,Persia Restaurant,The food is authentic and very delicious! Since I moved here I have been to this restaurant 5 times already and I was never disappointed
0,Simina I.,Melur & Thyme,"I was so happy to see that they open this restaurant in KL Sentral at the 5th floor.
I love this restaurant because they combine the western food with the eastern ingredients. Before you decide to go here to eat, you need to know that the place is halal, so they don't serve alcohol.

I had here Plancha Seafood Spaghetti, which is cooked with homemade plancha sauce and is served with grilled prawn and flower crab. The dish was delicious ....I think that this was the best pasta I had in KL until now. But I have to say that the price is quite high. I payed only for the dish RM40. But the great part of the restaurant is that they have also cheaper dishes for approx. RM20.

The outlet in KL Sentral has to parts: an amazing terrace where you can have a nice view, and the inside area with A.C.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing...elegant and with class."
0,Jacky L.,Melur & Thyme,"This was the fanciest restaurant I could find at NU Sentral, they had a nice view and the prices was not expensive. The service was good and they had a great selection of fusion food. The food was very flavorful, rightfully so for the Rendang lamb shank with butter rice. The clam chowder though was quite too flavorful for my liking. The croissant scrab spaghetti was also quite special, with the spaghetti served on a croissant. The fresh carrot juice seemed a bit watered down.
Altogether it was an enjoyable dining experience."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Melur & Thyme,"Melur & Thyme is a rather high class setting place that serves local food. Oh, pardon me - great local food. And, besides that, they do have a pretty interesting menu of fusions as well!

If you are someone who appreciate creative food menu, you would love this place.

Price wise, they are not entirely on the cheap side, but for the food and environment that's provided here, I think all is fair.

They do have live bands during weekend nights, where this place would be packed and be a great place to chill with friends.

So, if you are coming for dinner, don't come too late as you will not want to wait in a long line right?"
0,Sara M.,Melur & Thyme,"This place is cool, They serve different kind of cuisines, I believe you can get a decent burger from there, much better than McDonalds for sure, but I didn't find anything special. I guess I've had better or maybe I wasn't hungry enough. but the place is really quiet and chill for friends or even family.

I wouldn't recommend it as a first option, Malaysia has so much option with so many international and national cuisines it's so hard to pick really so this is going to depend on what are you craving right now! just follow that."
0,Kaan E.,Melur & Thyme,"Its hard to find high quality restaurant in Nu sentral. This is one of them. This place has a good combination of local and western cuisines. However, quality comes with price. I had pan fried salmon and cost 40 rm without any drinks. Portion was satisfactory but again i found the price little bit expensive compared to same class alternatives"
0,Rebecca W.,Restoran Stadium Negara,"Despite the name, the restaurant is not located at the national stadium but in the KL City Centre, instead. The must have for their customers is the charcoal steamboat, but we did not go for this.

One of the must order is their Grilled Squid! The squid seems like a very simple dish but it was perfectly charred and the smokiness was so delicious that no dipping sauce was required. Another highlight of the night was the BBQ Chicken Wings. I was quite sceptic with this at first, because I've had BBQ chicken wings hundred of times but they were all the same. The chicken wings at Restoran Stadium Negara were different. The wings were smoky and juicy, and the sweetness of the glaze was just nice. On the other hand, the clams and crabs that we ordered were not so memorable. I would prefer my crabs to be more meaty and theirs were not.

It's advisable to wear casual when dining at Restoran Stadium Negara because most of the sitting areas are outdoors. The place is most of the time crowded, and you'll see foreigners dining at the restaurant too. Although they are not halal, but the restaurant is pork free."
0,Nicole S.,Restoran Stadium Negara,"Stadium Negara Restaurant has been at Jalan Yap Kwan Seng for the longest time and we've been coming here for steamboat since i was a little kid. The atmosphere here is very normal, nothing great at all. The steamboat also i would say is mediocre so i dont get why they are so packed sometimes.

Pricing is average too but this is definitely not my go to place for steamboat. it used to e very good if i remember correctly but quality has deteriorated since."
0,Michael S.,Naughty Nuri’s,"Great place. Ribs are amazing. The staff is large helpful and friendly. The bar is HUGE. They served us a chocolate cake on a ""chocolate syrup sizzling"" cast iron plate. Fantastic! The ribs are great!  Try the open air seating on the right. It's a balcony yet still with AC."
0,Jonathon H.,Naughty Nuri’s,"Super fun with our young family! Reasonably priced and tasty food for all the different tastes. We really enjoyed our meal and would come back (the average of all our patrons came to 4 stars, but I would personally give it 5)."
0,Biswajit D.,Hawker Chan,"Michelin Stars are the Oscars for Restaurant. A street food chef was stunned after his hawker stall became the world's first to earn Michelin star. There was so much hype around this that I had  to try Hawker Chan's Soya Sauce Chicken Rice. It's a recently opened place in Malaysia (Chan is from Ipoh Malaysia). It's a simple menu and the fast food chain is good. They don't accept credit  cards. If you are a tourist and are visiting China town, stop here for your meal."
0,Carmen P.,Fatty Bak Kut Teh & Fish Head,"Fatty is an awesome roadside bak kut teh joint. The meat is tender and soup has depth with lots of flavour.

They also have fresh fish for those who don't eat meat.

Only open on the evenings and they are other stalls next to it that sells fried banana, sweet potato, yam fritters etc that's a great snack while waiting."
0,John W.,Fatty Bak Kut Teh & Fish Head,"- Need to start with bak kut teh - 1/5. Do not get the combo, the soup is pretty tasteless. RM13.50
- Fish -4.5/5.  Unfortunately I didn't take pics this time but I will next time. The fish is very fresh, meaty, tender, and simply very well done. I got the chilly sauced fish. Highly recommended. The fish was RM33 for two people.
- Inside seating is very humid, but outside seating is comfortable if you don't mind the passing traffic.
- Recommended for family dinners where fish is the main dish.
- PARKING : There is parking before and after the restaurant location. If you park in front of the mall, you'd have to pay the hustlers. Instead, drive slightly down the road, there should be 'parking' along the left side of the road."
0,Edmond Y.,Kazoku-Ai Modern Teppanyaki Kitchen,"THE BEST teppanyaki I've had in KL ever! The manager's food recommendations are awesome, he even talks about his food with fiery passion! The seafood platter was awesome, the ""psycho"" salmon really flavourful. Oh man, I'd come here again. Prices are on the high side, but gosh, so worth it. Very satisfied. Give it a try, I'd be back."
0,Rose K.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"Came here with colleagues.   The Australian beef was by far the best steak steak I've ever eaten.  

Everyone enjoyed their ribs and steaks.

Very attentive staff.

Definitely a go to place for great steaks."
0,Vernon C.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"The steaks here are still one of thr best in town, but the other items on the menu are only mediocre only. But if you want Steak, then here is the place to be."
0,Rebecca W.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"I'm super choosy when it comes to my steak and have been disappointed by a lot famous steakhouse in Klang Valley. However, Jake's Charbroil Steak has never let me down! They have 2 outlet - Medan Damansara (on the way to Bangsar), and Starhill Gallery. The interior is very American steakhouse-style with wooden chairs and tables.

My usual order would be Tenderloin done medium rare, and it's really satisfying - tender and juicy steak, pink in the center with a hint of dark red in the middle. I would recommend their Oxtail Soup and Lobster Bisque - both of them were flavourful.

No matter weekdays or weekends, the place is always packed with patrons. So I would recommend calling up for reservation instead of walking in, just to avoid any disappointment. As for parking, they have proper car park just outside the restaurant with a single entry payment. Alternatively, you could also use their valet service."
0,Annabelle Y.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"This restaurant used to be a family favorite, in fact we used to visit every year for my Mom's birthday until they started sending us birthday cards every year. That's how much the joint values family and loyalty of their patrons. This is the place to be for carnivores as they serve one of the most kick ass steaks in town. And if you think that means mediocre cuts of meat, you're wrong. They serve 3 varieties of meat - Wagyu, Black Angus and Grain Fed from Australia. They also have lamb cutlets which we had that night charbroiled and topped with an herb sauce with parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme for under RM80. The Australian Grain Fed Striploin was tender served with black pepper sauce - simple fare for RM 55.

What sets it apart from other steakhouses is that others marinate their meat to death before broiling but Jake's has a light hand on marinade due to the fact that they want their customers to taste the freshness of their meat and the natural juices that oozes out while it cooks. They also serve seafood and a Lobster Thermidor which we have yet to try but they do serve their version of fish and chips that is actually charbroiled fish fillet served with fries and salad. I would say it's definitely healthier than the fried variety for under RM 30.

If you're going to have a starter, I would say the oxtail is a good recommendation. Their famous dessert is the chocolate fudge brownie topped with melting ice cream, the perfect warm and cold combination to end the heaby meaty meal."
0,Andy L.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"Jake's Charbroil Steaks are one of those places that people know by their steaks and the fact that it should be Charbroiled rather than the word missing that present past tense it needs.

Grammar aside, Jake's offers steaks that rivals their biggest rivals, Victoria Station and The Ship. Despite it being located dangerously close to the first, their steaks are much juicier due to it being charbroiled, and their New York strip tastes tender and savory to the mouth, giving it a perfect texture for those who like it smoky.

Of course, the place is jam packed with humans who are eager to devour meat and tear some limbs. I recommend reaching there early to avoid disappointment, and then giving business to their rivals, whom are just right beside them. Ha."
0,Kevin W.,Jake's Charbroil Steaks,"If you really love steak, Jake's Charbroil Steaks are one of the best in Kuala Lumpur. My father brought me here many years ago but I am not a big steak fan, even today. I'd prefer poultry or seafood, and which this restaurant does not really put focus on any. As my parents order their steak, I had chicken, roasted chicken.
Well, it was alright but I think my mom's roasted chicken is better. Haha. However, I tried my parents' steak and I could see why they like it so much. The meat was tender and it has absorbed the flavouring that it cooked in. The portion was big and it was worth every cent on it. I like the environment, it feels like you're having dinner in an American steak house. The staff are friendly, serving the customers with a smile."
0,Patience G.,M8 Bar,"My kind of bar with good house tunes to dance to. Great themed nights, best bottles offers and the garden seating is to die for. With the Petronas twin towers as a backdrop, M8 Bar is the best place in town to watch the fireworks during Merdeka and NYE Sunday roast is an ideal place for the family. Kids below 10 eat for free. Free flow wines, beer and bubbles!"
0,Nina R.,Sassorosso,"How could I forget to review this awesome place??
Italian food might not be the first thing you imagine eating in Kuala Lumpur. However, we did!
First night in KL, tired after hours flying - this restaurant was perfect!
I do not actually recall what we ate, but it might have been pizza and some kind of pasta. The important thing is what I do remember: How utterly impressed we were by the food. It was so good!!!
We also got excellent wine paired with the meal."
0,Veronica C.,Sassorosso,"My first impression was 'Wow' because I've never been to this part of the city for dining and was pleasantly surprised to discover a lovely old bungalow converted into a fine dining restaurant.

It is the kind of restaurant you would bring your date for an intimate dinner or spouse to celebrate your anniversary. On top of that, it would also make a good venue for a wedding dinner or lunch for a small group of family members and very close friends.

The Italian owner was around. He was warm & friendly. I was there with my expatriate colleague from the Philippines and the wait staff became really friendly with us. Service is very good.

One thing I like immediately was the huge display of wine in an air-conditioned room. Instantly, I was assured of having good wine with my dinner. I've stayed in Rome and tasted original Italian food. Clearly, I wasn't disappointed.

This restaurant is on the top of my recommendation list."
0,Hobart L.,Sassorosso,"My Italian boss described this as the closest thing in town to proper Italian food, so we had really high hopes for this place. As someone who spent a summer in Italy, I was not completely blown away, but nonetheless it was a very satisfying meal with a few outstanding dishes. Pizza was probably the surprising dish of the night (see below for details), and pasta was generally pretty good. Was not too big a fan of the dessert, but my friend thought it was the best tiramisu she had. Prices were a bit on the expensive side (~RM100 per person without wine), but dishes were generally good quality, so no complaints.

Dishes to get:
- Sassorosso Pizza: Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Escargots, Marinated Mushrooms, Prawns & Fresh Basil
Pretty thin crust but neither too crispy or chewy, fresh ingredients, balanced flavors, just like how proper Italian pizza should be. And this is pretty high praise since I was in New Haven in 4 years (home of the best pizza in America!) and Italy for 2 months. Thoroughly surprised. Won't say it is the best pizza I've ever had, but for Malaysia this is outstanding

- Gratinated Eggplant Parmigiana Layers of Eggplant, Tomato &  Mozzarella Cheese
My friend who doesn't like eggplants at all really enjoyed this dish. Think this pretty much sums up this dish. Slices of eggplants coated with layers of mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. Amazing!

- Squid Ink Tagliatelle Fresh Homemade Pasta Served with Scallops, Broccoli, Olive Oil, Garlic & Chilli
Flavorful, fresh scallops, a sauce that is not too overpowering. Lovely dish

Dishes to avoid:
- Oven Baked Australian Lamb Noisette Served with Kalamata Mashed & Fresh Thyme Sauce
I like lamb, but even then this dish was way too gamey and chewy for my liking. Want a lamb dish with almost no gamey taste, go to Bakar. That dish was a bit underwhelming, but people forget how difficult it is to cook lamb properly

- Creme brûlée
It wasn't bad, but it was just way too sweet and vanilla-ey for my liking. No balance at all, and unfortunately that is king in dessert, because if not we'd all just crank up the sugar and be done with dessert."
0,Rachel R.,Din Tai Fung,"This location is just as good as any of the others I have visited.  And on a Thursday evening at 7pm, it was half-empty so no waiting!

It is located on the 6th floor, all the way at the end (near the ""Dining Loft"").

If you haven't been before, once you are seated they give you an ordering sheet and a menu (with photos). Mark what you want on your sheet and someone will come by and confirm your order.  There is plenty for vegetarians and they have noted various ingredients with icons on the menu to accommodate all sorts of dietary restrictions.

They are known for their XLB and my boy also likes the spicy wantons.  I always go for veggie dumplings but don't get so blinded by dumplings and buns that you overlook other dishes... the garlic spinach is fantastic!

When you are done eating, take your bill to the register to pay.  Two of us stuffed ourselves for the equivalent os USD $17."
0,Kenneth W.,Din Tai Fung,"Exactly what you come to eat any DTF around Asia. Friendly and fast service. Extra stand by table for your bags and belongings.  

XLB is great as usual. Saving room for noodle elsewhere.  But you have my loyalty."
0,Emily S.,Din Tai Fung,"Honestly- quite disappointing.

I live on the east coast in the states so DTF is not accessible so I was super super hyped to try this in Malaysia. We ordered quite a lot of food for a large group so we could try everything but everything we ordered lacked flavor. The soup dumplings are pretty average at best. Noodles didn't taste great either. There was this scallop appetizer that was pretty good though.

My friend said the one in Cali was much better so I guess i would give it a second chance if I ever end up there."
0,lina w.,Din Tai Fung,Never fail the taste. Din Tai Fun all over the world always keep their food and staff standard above and beyond. Disappointed that green beans sold out again. They have chicken fillings. But I always have my truffle one.
0,Mashel M.,Din Tai Fung,"Din Tai fung is simply soup dumpling perfection. the most sensuous texture of the dumpling as it's volcanic broth explodes on your tongue is one of life's must try pleasures, we ate here 3 nights out of the 12 we spent in KL"
0,Annie N.,Din Tai Fung,"Came here for dinner on my last night at Kuala Lumpur I love my street food vendors and everything but I was having a little first world problem and I missed dining with service and In an air conditioned space. My friend and I decided to come here and we we glad we did, there was no wait on a Monday night at 8pm and the food and service was amazing everyone was so polite and cheerful, it just brightens up your mood when even the servers who bring you the dish thanks you for dining there and hopes you enjoy your meal, like wow. Their iced lemon tea was really good and had a strong tea taste, the little dragon bun was a little soup-less for my preference but the crab taste was evident and the skin was super soft. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and I think a main part of it was due to the wonderful service we received."
0,YangHwa P.,Din Tai Fung,"Every time I am in KL, I go to Din Tai Fung in Pavilion. The service is good, attentive, and fast. The food is always amazingly delicious (just like Taiwan), and price is cheaper than any other DTF in other countries. You can definitely taste the freshness of their ingredients; and like other DTF you can see them making dumplings, other food, and drinks through the glass windows. My family and I always eat like kings and queens here for such moderate price. It's inside a huge mall so after we eat at DTF we just walk around and burn off the calories. We always try to get there around 11am before it gets crowded. By 12:00pm it gets crowded and the line starts to form outside the restaurant. There are other DTF locations in KL, but I personally like this location the best."
0,Linh B.,Din Tai Fung,"Greatest fried rice in town I guess!! Dumplings are awesome!! Highly recommend to all tourists.
The restaurant is located on the six floor behind the escalator. It took us a while to walk around to find it :))"
0,Joseph Y.,Din Tai Fung,"I LOVE Din Tai FUNG!!!!

That being said, I was close to giving it a 5...first the good.....

1. Waited less than 10 minutes for a table, if any of you have ever gone to a Din Tai Fung, you know how long the wait can be.
2.  CHEAPEST DTF I have ever been to, but that is due to the country.
3.  Food is ALWAYS Solid!

Now the disappointing parts....
1.  They do not carry chicken fried noodle here. (Can't blame it for that)
2. Service was just ok, could have been a little better
3.  They were out of a lot of items, (Cucumber and string beans) at 8pm :/

All this said, I am planning on going back this week.  I LOVE DTF and would HIGHLY recomeend to make a stop here."
0,Annabel H.,Din Tai Fung,"So much for so little money!! Definitely very filling
Not a lot of vegetarian options"
0,Regina N.,Din Tai Fung,"Whether I'm in Taiwan or KL, this restaurant constantly has a line at the door. Be prepared to wait in line during busy lunch hours.

You know why? It's because they have the best dim sum around for the most affordable prices. I don't think I've spent more then $30 for two people at either location.

The menu is simple and easy to navigate (photos), the restaurant spotless (especially this particular one because it's in the world famous Pavillion Mall) and the decor contemporary.

Most important the vibe is always bustling. What's a dim sum experience without a lunch vibe where everyone is salivating over the food in the carts?

This is a ""must eat"" place, over and over and over again."
0,Michele Q.,Din Tai Fung,"Couldn't wait until I was in Taiwan to try DTF so KL it was!  Arrived around opening time to no wait which was great.  We ordered the jellyfish (which was probably the best I've had to date, so we ended ordering a second round!), custard buns (which were oozing with deliciousness), wonton noodle soup, a 10-piece chicken and crab XLB and a 10-piece pork and crab XLB.  I can now see what the hype is about DTF.  You can really taste the crab in these and the soup inside was fantastic.  Another great thing, the bill at the end of the meal :)."
0,Wina K.,Din Tai Fung,"People probably think it's strange that I dine at franchise restaurants while visiting other countries. The quick & easy answer is because:
1. Popular Asian franchises in the bay area almost always means an hour plus wait. In other countries, you can walk right in and expect the same/similar food & better service.
2. I unfortunately have a sensitive stomach so if I need to play it safe, these types of spots are the way to go.

Now, for the food:

The must haves:
- Pork XLB - perfect size, flavor, and a burst of soup at each bite.
- Truffle XLB's - I love truffle and this dumpling packs a burst of flavor so I do recommend it ONLY if you like truffle. Otherwise it can get quite pricey. Tip: You can order just one dumpling to try!
- Pork fried rice - Delicious seasoning & wok flavor. Simple & simply delicious.
- Hot & sour soup - The most flavorful, well balanced hot & sour I've ever had. The silky tofu was also a plus.

The less memorable:
- Spicy wonton - It's Ok. Order it if you're dining with a lot of people. Otherwise, you can skip it.
- Shrimp & pork shao mai - So pretty with a lot of potential but again, just Ok. Since they twisted the wrapper, it ends up being too thick of a dumpling.
- Shrimp & pork dumplings - thin silky skin with soup in the center too! Not bad but also not a must order.

Overall, 3.5 stars but rounding up. The best thing here is the XLB's. Everything else is just OK. If I had to wait in line, I'd be disappointed."
0,Jay C.,Din Tai Fung,"This place is located at the end of the 6th floor inside Pavilion Mall; the fanciest mall in KL.
Once seated, the ordering process is pretty simple. Check the menu, mark in the given list of food the quantity you want anf give it to the waitress. But, don't forget to mark the order size. Some has 3, 6 and 10 pieces per order.
Is pretty much a Dim Sum and noddle soup place. Their signature menu item is the Xiao Long Bao a steamed dumpling full of juice encased with thin outer layer of dumpling wrap.
With or without the sauce it taste pretty good. By the way, don't forget to make the Vinager and Soy Sauce mixture in the saucer with ginger slice. It is pretty good with the XLB.
The food is pretty good and flavorfull.
Definitely a plave that I'll love to comeback."
0,May T.,Din Tai Fung,I was super excited to eat here coming from the US.  But I was truly disappointed.  I was thinking it would be just as awesome but it tasted too bland with no flavor.  In US it melted in your mouth n fresh... delicious.  It was ok.  Thank you though.  Service was ok not wonderful like US
0,Clarence J.,Din Tai Fung,"Din Tai Fung is very good.  The extensive menu has far more wonderful-looking options than I could try on one visit...so I'll just have to return.  There are dumplings of all types, mostly with pork, chicken, fish, or vegetable filling.  (Through the front window, you can watch staff members putting the dumplings together.)  The menu also has numerous noodle dishes and several soups.  All the dumplings I tried had excellent flavor.  I thought the temperature was a bit inconsistent though -- some seemed to have been sitting for a while, while others seemed to have gone immediately from the chef to our table.  

The large restaurant is bright from high ceilings, light wood, and the good-sized windows on one side.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  (One note: if you arrive with any bags, don't be surprised when the staff provides a wood-and-canvas holder for them, which will then be covered with a cloth that seemed intended to prevent food falling on the bags.)"
0,Adelynn T.,Din Tai Fung,"Was here with J the other day for lunch. Since we were on a 'diet', we decided to share. So, as usual, xiao long bao was on the list. After flipping pages over and ove again, we picked the pork with glass noodles soup. Xiao long bao was not as juicy/soupy as it was. So it's not up to the standard. :( on the other hand, the noodles were good. Not too bad. Not that oily as we expected *Since there's pork in it*.

Overall experience : 4/5
Service : 5/5 (The waiter noticed that I didn't have a pair of chopsticks as he sat us down. He replaced one pair immediately)
Price Rating : 4/5 (Quality is still there)"
0,Alex R.,Din Tai Fung,"Delicious!
Tried hot and sour soup, wonton soup, and several orders of dim sum. Casual place to eat, with good energy, friendly service, and yummy food!"
0,Andrew F.,Din Tai Fung,"Service may not be the greatest but omg are those Soup Dumplings amazing. I had heard raves from people from all over the world and had never had the chance to try Din Tai Fung before. During Hari Raya there was a very short line so I got right in and within fifteen minutes had my food.
The Din Tai Fung vegetarian special was very off-putting but I wasn't betting on it. I was excited for the chicken soup dumplings. I ordered six dumplings aloing with six veggie dumplings of another kind and both were absolutely delectable. I ended up clearing my plate of soup dumplings singlehandedly and then nearly completing the veggie ones. On my next visit I'll likely stick to the chicken soup dumplings because they may be the greatest thing I've ever had the pleasure of tasting in any country, anywhere. FANTASTIC!"
0,Erich D.,Din Tai Fung,"My wife and I are always DTF (down to feast) on some DTF dumplings anywhere in Asia or around the world!

In terms of getting more bang for your buck, this particular location rules! The food here is on par with ones we've eaten at in other parts of Asia and in the US, but with a lower price tag! We consumed more food here than we did in Singapore on our most recent SE Asia trip but payed about $15 less in total for our group. We even sprung for the truffle XLB here (which are amazing)."
0,James L.,Pulp,"It wasn't the easiest place to find when I first visit Pulp. It's situated in front of this warehouse where you will never think that it is actually a coffee house. The exterior is almost similar to the other parts of the warehouse but recently I'm seeing some decoration works to the exterior to make it stand out. A good change I must say.

There's about 10 tables or so with one very interesting table that is actually a printing press machine being converted into a table plus decoration piece. It is quite warm in this place because the only thing that is keeping you away from the hot sun is the bare roof. So do find a spot away from the sun or you will melt.

The coffee is top notch here and the staffs are pleasant and nice. Definitely a place I would pop by anytime for coffee and meals even!"
0,Kenji Y.,Pulp,"A hidden coffee shop where young people gather.

I felt the rating was overhyped. The location is in the middle of nowhere, air conditioning was weak, and it was crowded with not many seating

There was one or two menus floating around so we couldn't see the menu until we made it to the front. Worker offered no help.

Maybe about 20 seats but they are mostly taken by people chatting or reading.  Some open seats weren't possible to get to because of the seating arrangement.

Worst part was the heat. We were sweating like it was outdoors.

Not worth taking a trip out for

Points for decent coffee with basic latte art skills."
0,Connie L.,Pulp,"The cafe has a lofty industrial feel with the ceilings and large windows, which makes sense since this used to be a printing factory.

My friend and I came here during our vacation and got a latte and one of their cold brews. They also have pastries. The place is comfortable and a  great escape from the heat.

The space also has an education room where they have cuppings!

It seems like they have wifi as we saw people on laptops."
0,Andrew S.,Pulp,"I found a cafe I want to come back to over and over! The atmosphere is urban industrial yet cozy and comfortable. Has a little hipster-ish vibe to it but it's not overly done. Their coffees are exceptionally good and they help point you in the right direction if it's your first time here. The music they play is calm mellow beats that get you in a vibing mood. Whether you're meeting up with a friend or just relaxing this is a spot to check out! If they had a few couches, it'd be perfect! Looking forward to coming back!"
0,Peter G.,Pulp,"I was touring around KL looking for a place that had nice atmosphere and was serious about their coffee. This place hit the spot. Apart from the expertly brewed coffee, they have an awesome collection of equipment and also a Trust Your Palate  self serve bar. You can sample some different beans. This is a place committed to educating their customers. They also have Public Cupping sessions on Saturday."
0,ChongJin T.,Pulp,"Located at a remote area of hustle bustle bangsar, Jalan Riong. They have similar concept as their Singapore counterpart Chye Seng Huat Hardware. They have a very unique concept which house a cafe, open space with a display area of the equipments that they sell.

Their staff and very knowledgable and they know coffee really well. Try to ask them for a good advice on what kind of single origin bean is good for your liking :)

My personal advice is , try to go when there is lesser crowd or non peak hours, as when it is pack it could be a little bit pack and noisy"
0,Lennise N.,Pulp,"From the first glance, you wouldn't be able to tell that this is a café. It looks like some industrial storage space on the outside (this is when they did not put out the chairs at the front). It's a totally different story once you've stepped inside. The high ceiling space made it look so much bigger. State of the art coffee machines are strategically located around the café and you can watch these talented baristas work their magic.

The decor is quite minimalistic with no fancy art propped up against the wall. My first impression when I stepped into this place is that these people are really serious about their coffee. Which is fantastic! There is a section of the café that allows you to  experience their filter coffee. It's great to hover around that area and learn a thing or two.

Additionally, all staff here are well trained in handling new coffee lovers to coffee connoisseurs. If I'm not mistaken, they do hold coffee appreciation sessions. I did not enquire much about this as I was in a hurry but that's a great activity to do if you have a thing for coffee. This might be even a cool date plan.

I ordered a house specialty blend latte and as expected, it tasted amazing. The Brazilian beans added a tinge of dry fruity flavor to the coffee. I've not tried the cakes but they do look delish!

The only unfortunate thing here is that they've got no WiFi. This means I always have to use my phone's hot spot to work here and I cannot afford to ramp up my data bill every month just because I love getting some work done at this place. Ahh guess I'll only visit when I'm out to meet people."
0,Rebecca W.,Pulp,"PULP is a Malaysia flagship store of Papa Palheta from Singapore. It's located at Jalan Riong, in the same compound as NSTP. The moment you can see the orange NSTP building in front of you, PULP is not far away. Alternatively, you can just find your way there easily via Waze (search word: PULP).

The interior is simple and the high ceilings allowed the natural lights to come through, thus brighten up the entire space. One down side would be their limited seats. Joe and I managed to grab a sit on our first visit, but wasn't so lucky on our subsequent visits.

Instead of the usual selections, they offer more specialty coffee here in PULP. There'll be a list of coffee at the counter, but you are always welcome to consult with the baristas and they will be more than willing to explain it to you. I tried their Konga Cold Brew and really liked the hint of floral and lemony aroma that came with it. However, if you prefer to add milk into your coffee, they have some simple ones like Latte and Flat White.

0,abu h.,Pulp,"BEST ARTISAN COFFEE IN KL. AMAZING PLACE. expensive , but if you are really a coffee drinker , you have to try this place."
0,Weinye C.,Pulp,"Pulp is situated in a rather random spot. It's not really that noticeable if you're just driving by. I went there around 4.30pm on a Monday and it was a little crowded and it only simmered down around 7pm. I thought it would've been a little quieter as I was there to get some work done on my laptop. Music selection was really good.

Only downside is that there is no wifi here but luckily for me, my work didn't really require me to go online. Customer service is really friendly and attentive. I got a bottle of the ice brew coffee for RM15. Not bad but not the best I've had. All in all, comfortable place to sit for a couple of hours to work or catch up with friends.

Also, Breakfast Thieves is just right next to Pulp."
0,YongJie L.,Pulp,"Pulp is one of the hipster place in the town.
You will be amazed when you drive to the place as this cafe located behind a abandoned factory. However, it doesn't affect the outlook and the design of this cafe. Indeed, I love the ambience there. It's a very cool place that full of the coffee scent. However I'm not a coffee lover, hence I can't comment anything on the coffee. But I heard their cold brew is not bad and it's packaging is cool as well, which is filled in a brown color bottle.

I had once tried its desserts. It was actually so so, nothing that impressed me. Apart from that, this cafe is actually not very big and doesn't have many seatings. Therefore, it usually get full easily. Moreover, unlike other cafes, Pulp doesn't provide any free internet access (wifi), which it won't be a good place for you to sit down and work."
0,Sara M.,Pulp,"This place is unrecognisable! I was trying to find a nice cafe near home and I was told about this place so I walked there but then I couldn't recognize it, it looked like a company's parking lot entrance but then there it was! I really liked the design and atmosphere though! I do like that it doesn't seem like a cafe from the outside. those are usually the best honestly!

I was disappointed that they only had one kind of cold coffee and that it was expensive as hell! I'm definitely not going back there for the simple reason that if I am to spend so much on my coffee then might as well just check out Starbucks finest coffee."
0,William D.,Pulp,"This hidden coffee Mecca can be found in a very unassuming spot in Bangsar.  When I got out of my taxi I looked around and thought I was in the wrong place.  There is no big sign and the building blends in with the quasi industrial feel of the rest of the block.  

On the inside it is a Bangsar hipster coffee drinkers paradise.  I'm not a big coffee drinker myself, but you can tell that great care is taken with coffee here.  The menu is limited to almost entirely coffee and it fills the place with the lovely aroma.  

The music was great and the staff is intelligent.  I felt very comfortable and it was a great place for my brief casual business meeting."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Pulp,"Nitro black coffee - I would say that this is the bomb here! Here for my first time for Coffice Hours and I totally liked what the barista suggested me to get. Not bitter, nutty with a citrusy twist - this month they are serving the cold brew with Nitrogen that I definitely like!

Not totally on the cheap side, you pay RM16 for a glass of Nitro Black Coffee, but I would think that it's worth the price.

Parking at Pulp is quite a breeze during weekdays, in my opinion. There are plenty of parking spaces outside APW, of course during peak hours it might be hard.

I also tried their cheese cake, which was great. It's not the super soft and tender texture as I have expected, it's slight grainy and coarse, and to my surprise I liked it! Gonna try some of their other cakes the next visit!

Loved the place, except for they do not provide WiFi here. So, might not be that suitable to get some work done here. Other than that, love it!"
0,Maher S.,Pulp,A great coffee please didn't try the food but the desert was gear and very friendly workers and the boos looks very friendly
0,KarFei C.,Pulp,"Located at the weirdest place of all; an old printing factory compound, Pulp is a coffee specialty cafe by Papa Palheta from Singapore. Papa Palheta in Singapore is a coffee boutique that serves quality coffee and the run by the people behind the Cyhe Seng Huat Hardware cafes (yes, hardware lol).

Matched to it's counterpart reputation, Pulp serves really good and quality coffee. They have different types of brewing and preparation method in which comes in different pricing. On the side, they serve scones, cakes and some pastries. Their walnut chocolate brownies looks great, but I did not try it as I was on my no-sugar diet on that day :/

The most interesting thing about Pulp for a coffee addict like me is their focus on creating good coffee. If you have a chance to visit Pulp, you will be amazed by not only their coffee selection, but also their selection of coffee beans and tools and equipments to brew coffee. They sell premium espresso machines, coffee grinder, mugs, and etc.

Pulp is definitely a place that serves on of the best coffee for a coffee addict like me. The down side of this place is that the space is a little small (I have to wait for seats most of the time when I drop by) and they dont have wifi too (good for spending some time with friends, not good when I drop by to actually have a good cuppa and finish up my work)."
0,Leslie C.,Pulp,"Great place if you like your coffee and if you want to buy fresh beans plus the equipment that goes with it.
But also a great venue because it's actually in the compound of an actual printing plant."
0,Zhenchi L.,Pulp,"Cafe disguised as a warehouse!

Pulp has one of the best concepts in KL, hands down. This cafe has a simple elegance to its design. The interior is has high ceilings and allows the right amount of natural light to flow into the cafe.

PULP has created quite a buzz since its establishment. They serve some of the best cold brew coffee I've had. I've heard they supply beans to some of other well known cafe's around the area.

I'd recommend swinging by PULP during a weekday during off-peak hours, they tend to get really crowded during the weekends."
0,Jen S.,Pulp,"This place is located basically near nothing-your sole purpose of coming to this area will either be for the art gallery also located in the same complex or this place. The staff was rude and pretentious towards us, they were sold out of half the menu by 11am when we arrived, the place has no wifi and the food we were able to get here was average. The cost of our bill was a whopping 82 ringits- and for that I really expected to be blown away. Sadly I wasn't, even by the coffee. The coffee was good, but not great, nor the best I had in Kuala Lumpur and for the busyness of the place good luck getting a seat when you arrive or when your food does. Then I am guessing because they were busy everything took forever, ordering (10 minutes), finding a seat (10 minutes more), getting our food (40 minutes later), getting our coffee(10 minutes after our food). Our overall experience was very blah and we won't be back. The lazy service, average food, average coffee and for such a high price was a huge turn off for us. I had really high hopes for this place as well since it had such outstanding reviews."
0,Vivian Y.,Pulp,"Pulp would be a really hip place to have coffee. The baristas all look really professional and their coffee is amazing, even their hot chocolate. There are only a few tables in the cafe which makes seating really limited. It's really simplistic and woody, the interior of the cafe.

Parking can be a hassle because you can't park inside. There is also a paper factory and a warehouse beside the cafe. The cafe would be said to be really hipster. People would always be taking photos and publicizing the place. Fun fact, they also sell aprons and coffee stuff in the cafe, so feel free to ask them if you need anything or have any questions. These people are truly the coffee experts. The coffee art is really nice as well."
0,Vanessa O.,Nasi Lemak Hilton Corner,"During the morning, nasi lemak Hilton corner sells nasi lemak and they are not overpriced! Being Malaysian, nasi lemak is our common breakfast and people do find having nasi lemak not heavy for a breakfast - well I actually do.

They do sell economical nasi lemak for breakfast and approaching 11am, the stall will be set up with a variety of food from ayam goreng, and etc and they are prepared for the lunch time where people will just flock in to buy their lunch.

Just tell the makcik for a pack of rice and she will give you the plain rice and it will be up to you to go around the stall to pick up your food. Then bring it to the side and pay for it.

It won't cost a lot and usually the minimal that you have to pay is RM5 per serving of food."
0,Jia J.,Cu Cha,"I went to Jalan Alor once and didn't get good food experience (high price, oily food, average test). Yesterday, I went there again at noon and only a few restaurants were operating.

I chose Cu Cha due to the wide variety available on their menu. Everything you can get is at least RM3-RM5 more expensive than the normal price. For example, one plate of Char Koay Teow is RM 8 instead of RM 5.

Missing what I ate in Hong Kong, so, I ordered Fried Kuey Teow with Beef (干炒牛河）. To my surprise, it tasted really well. My mates ordered Char Keoy Teow (Malaysia style) and fried rice, and both gave thumbs up for their meals. Not oily and good portion (slighter larger than average serving size). I went at noon and the place was really quiet, we are the only customers at that moment.

Very clean restaurant with light air-conditioning. My meal costs RM9, but I had really good experience. It really breaks my stereotype of Jalan Alor having food for tourists only. Thanks to Cu Cha!"
0,Robin C.,Yong Tau Foo Hawker,"A humble hawker stall that sells local favourite, this place has been around for umpteen years. The wide selection of Yong Tau Foo (A Chinese dish literally translated as fish stuffed tofu) and soft & finely made ""Chee Cheong Fun"" (rice noodle roll originated as southern Chinese staple) attract the locals of various local ethnicities (Malay, Chinese, Indian) in the morning up to lunch time. Come after 2pm, and they'll sold out for sure. A must try if you're around the corner! It's located just by an alley from the main road."
0,Char L.,Restoran Han Kee,"For the last few days, my wife and I had been eating in Food Courts. For tonite we wanted something else. We walked into KL China Town and found this place Han Kee.
Ordered 3 dishes - A soup, Bean Curd, and Pipis in spicy sauce. Many Chinese restaurants in Asia allow you to order one of 3 sizes - Sml. Med. Lge. With two people, ordering all Sml size gave us opportunity to order 3 dishes. The range of dishes was very large and it does cater for all tastes.
We were very pleased with our selection- Soup-Sea Food-Bean Curd. There was no waste.
I can recommend this restaurant. Good Range. Good Service. Good Chinese Food. I will come again, next time I'm in KL."
0,Vanessa O.,Restoran Han Kee,"It's a family affair that evening that brought me here all the way to Petaling Street's Jalan Sultan. Although I kinda grew up at this area as I have my tuition classes or extra Chinese classes here, I never thought that I could find such nice Chinese food. I have the perception that Petaling Street is no longer Chinatown merely because it is dominated by foreigners. Well, you don't get me wrong; it can be quite dangerous to travel around this area at night. It is rather intimidating. All of the foreigners (men especially) will give you a certain stare and looked at you indifferent. So girls out there, please be extra careful and never walk alone at night in Petaling Street (personal advice!).

Since this restaurant is operated by a long lost family friend, I didn't really put high hopes to it. I was totally wrong!! We order 5 different vegetables (fish, lala, tofu, vege& fried sotong), all was extremely delicious!!!

The lady boss will slowly explain to you what their famous dish is and you will be tempted to go for it when you see other tables' ordering. They smell really good too!! Taste of the food is delicious! The Lala was really spicy and well cooked, tofu was really soft inside and it will just melt when you put inside your mouth, sotong was fresh, fish was well cooked and I could only give 5 stars for the chef's cooking!!

If you don't know what to order, you can actually go through their menu and there are pictures and prices and you will never go wrong with it.

Highly recommended!!!"
0,Nick N.,Fuego,"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5

They had the best Guacamole I've ever had in my life! No joke! People think I'm crazy when I tell them the best Guac in the world is in Malaysia, lol. The Nacho Churros were to die for as well! Everything was just A+. Would love to come back here and try the entire menu. View was amazing as well!"
0,Jennifer B.,Fuego,"I can't say that I'm overly impressed with this place.  When my friend and I arrived, the host wanted to throw us in a corner b/c she said all the tables were reserved.  Funny, b/c in the hour or so that we were there, there were at least seven tables that were never sat.  And they could have very well been reserved for later reservations, but why not let us sit there and tell us we need to be done by a certain time?

The food was just okay.  I had the nacho churros and a couple of drinks.  The first two drinks I tried to order, I was told they were ""sold out"".  Hmmm.  I finally got a drink order in and when I tasted it, I was thoroughly unimpressed.  The drink was thick and the ingredients didn't really vibe well.  The churros were innovative in presentation, but again the ingredients just didn't do it for me.  Maybe b/c the bread was almost immediately soggy from the guac and duck fat.  I dunno, but we had seen enough.  We took our pictures, and high-tailed it to the next spot on our list."
0,Eddie R.,Fuego,"So after and epic fail at the Atmosphere 360 restaurant we decided to salvage the night and found this little gem. A little confusing to get to, as you have to maneuver yourself though two towers and then several restaurants and bars before reaching the last spot, Fuego. The views are amazing, the staff friendly, and the music was perfect. We did not have any food as we just had the worst meal across the street at the tower, but the food selection looked amazing. I would recommend this spot for drinks and amazing views!"
0,Eveline L.,Fuego,"Fuego is one of those few restaurants with a great view of the twin towers. It is an outdoor dining place so it does get a little warm here depending on the weather. Do make reservations as tables are quire limited.

Portion here is generous and price is definitely affordable with such ambience. They're famous for their guacamole and ceviche. But I would say the most memorable dish was the berry pavlova! I absolutely loved it. You'll also find a good selection of cocktails here.

If you're looking for a romantic place to dine, you might prefer Cantaloupe or Strato as the music here is quite lively and loud."
0,Clarence J.,Fuego,"(This is probably closer to 4.5 stars to me.)  Fuego is a solid Latin American restaurant with an absolutely beautiful setting.  Set in an open-air niche on the 23rd floor of the Troika building, the restaurant has a wide-open view of Kuala Lumpur, looking westward from a side view over KLCC Park.  The three-story high ceiling means the view is open to the sky, which gives you a feeling of being on a rooftop.  (You know, instead of 'just' on the outside of an upper floor of a building. :-) )  All of this provides for wonderful views looking out onto a great cityscape -- including a great line of the Petronas Twin Towers, Petronas Tower 3 (Menara Carigali), and Menara KL -- and over to mountains in the distance.  

The dining space itself is smallish, with basically two rows of tables -- the first along the glass-and-steel railing and the other set just back from that one.  There are perhaps around 80 seats.  A long bar stretches along the opposite side of the tables from the railing, and the open-ish kitchen is off to one side.  The décor is lively, with reds, blues, and browns, and cool metal grates -- which made me think of significantly oversized lobster traps -- give character to the space overhead.

The food has wonderful flavors.  The menu is a good size, built of small-ish sections of appetizers -- especially the guacamoles -- ceviches, small plates, large plates, sides, and desserts.  The friendly, attentive staff suggested an appetizer, a ceviche, two small plates, a large plate, and a side or two for two people; that seemed about right, spread out over two hours.  There's a large menu of cocktails and wines, with smaller menus of beer and liquors.  

Fuego is definitely pricey, but while the view may be the top selling point, the food and drinks are solid also."
0,Britanni J.,Fuego,"As a westener I really try to steer clear of any non local food when I travel. Especially when it's something I can get back home easily. However I had so many people Suggest this place and I am happy I finally decided to check it out.
The view is absolutely breathtaking, try to have your dinner during the sunset. At some point you can also hear the local mosque's call to prayer that echos through the city and that just adds a level of epic to the atmosphere that I can't describe. It's a very cool experience.
I had sangria which was perfect- not too sweet.
Also make sure you get the guacamole and try the ceviche.
This is a must visit anytime you are in town."
0,Fredrik B.,Fuego,"This was fantastic, we had a little trouble to find the place. Just for you to know in the floor 23A you have restaurant/bar claret wine bar, Cantaloupe, Strato Italian restaurant and Fuego.
I can only say that the food and the staff was fantastic.
I can recommend the sea bass, super.
The view out over petrona town in the sunset and evening was stunning.
Go there, enjoy."
0,Marija S.,Fuego,"If you like your meal with a view - you must check out FUEGO!
This restaurant will leave you breathless and you will not be able to concentrate on your meal or a friend, because the light from the twin towers will completely take all your attention!

You have to try their guacamole tortillas and French beef flank! And for dessert enjoy their watermelon salad! The best meal you can get in town, no doubt.

The manager of the restaurant is very friendly and when our group of friends encountered a few problems with the receipt ( there was extra bottle of champagne, which we didn't order), he offered us a discount and tequila shots for the whole table. I definitely recommend !"
0,Silver H.,Fuego,"Well stunning view, cosy & relax. Love the open air concept. Food is amazing especially the beef! Worth every penny spent for such good quality ingredients. And of coz the crews..they are the great people make the place amazing!"
0,Julie Y.,Fuego,"It's a party every night at Fuego where good company, creative cocktails and modern south American food are celebrated. It was a tuesday night where business would be slow for most food establishments but at Fuego, people were slowly trickling in just in time to catch the last rays of the sunset that loomed over the unparalleled view of the Petronas Twin Towers.

Known for its barbeque style fare and extensive menu boasting innovative cocktails and tapas, the vibe at Fuego is casual and relaxed so ditch your suits for shorts and polo tees especially since the restaurant is located outdoors and not air conditioned. Everything is elevated with a hint of fancy as even the water is infused with strawberry and basil or cucumber and thyme which makes it even more refreshing on a hot day.

Fuego takes its guacamole very seriously and I would recommend the super spicy guacamole, a sure hit with malaysians who love their chilli padi fuelled with ancho chillies served with crisps. The ceviches are also worth trying as the impact of the tangy citrus will be a shock to your tastebuds. Fuego also claims to serve the best churros in town and I liked how the smooth creamy chocolate dip against the salted caramel wasn't cloyingly sweet and the churros were perfectly fried to be crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside. Dishes at Fuego are usually made to be served so bring over a group of friends to enjoy the stunning skyscraper view while you sip on cocktails and watch the sun set."
0,Aja N.,Fuego,"KLs best kept secret, Fuego is ALWAYS booked out by tourists and expats.

Amazing view, great food, ambiance and service - no wonder! Pricy but really worth the experience, especially if you're showing someone around town and they want to see the magnificent twin towers.

Best at sundown, to now before the hotel they are building next to the towers obstructs the view."
0,Mina N.,Fuego,"Just came for drinks and dessert but I'd definitely come back for more.

Tried:
- latte
- watermelon juice
- berry cream meringue
- churros

They've really nailed the presentation with desserts. I feel ashamed for not taking photos.

They finished both desserts at the table. With the berries and cream, they lit the bourbon in fire and poured it over the meringue to give it the final toast. Pretty cool and tasted great--and I usually hate meringue.

With the churros the finish wasn't nearly as epic but still tasted great. They just added the salted caramel whipped cream at the table.

The view isn't as great as it once was because there is a tall skyscraper blocking the sky bridge now. But it's still a really cool atmosphere. I'd go back for the food alone. Ribs looked amazing. Would love to try those."
0,Ian L.,Fuego,"The latest brainchild of Troika Skydining is this strikingly-beautiful South American-inspired bar. And Fuego means fire in Spanish. With the lustrous Twin Towers as a background, the view is the money shot.
   But it was their cocktails and guacamole that won our hearts (and appetite).
The bar is headed by famed mixologist Rick Joore. Make sure you try some of his signature drinks like Buttered Rum and Port Flip.
  To go with your drinks, order their guacamole, prepared by their very own guacamole chefs. Besides the classic iteration, there's one with salmon roe and a spicy version with cili padi. Prices are on the high side, but for that view, we think it's definitely worth it."
0,Simina I.,Fuego,"From time to time we have to try something new. And a latin gastronomical experience is always welcome. The restaurant is specialised in Mexican cuisine which is KL is very rare to find  

At Fuego everything is on fire. In specially their food is a full show. They have great food, staff, view and the music is awesome.

The place has inside and outside seats, but I recommend you to stay outside so you can enjoy the outstanding views of K towers.

In regards to the food, their Quail eggs just melt in your mouth - would love to find out how they do it and the rocky road is the prefect dessert to go with the meal. Their cocktails are very good too. I tried their classic margarita with the burnt lemon, very unique and unlike the regular margaritas that i get in KL. It was a very relaxed and pleasant night. Will definitely be a regular here.

P.S. It's better to gave a reservation, if you wanna have seat at a table, and stay at the bar."
0,Pearl-Lyn L.,Fuego,"Had cocktails at Fuego once and I must say that the cocktails here are extremely delicious and yummy. Try the Asam boi margarita if you're feeling adventurous!

Fuego's environment is very chilled. You don't have to dress very fancy to dine here but the food and drinks are pricey. Service here is good and quick. If you're planning to dine here, don't forget to make a reservation in advance as they are usually fully booked.

The view from Fuego is spectacular as you can see the Petronas Twin Towers from the balcony. This place is the perfect place to catch up with friends and just enjoy the night."
0,Jim S.,Fuego,"Copper bar was amazing, great drinks, awesome feel.  The music set a great mood.  You can sit out on the deck.  We will go back."
0,Evelyn W.,Fuego,"So good, my visiting friends called it their highlight of KL. Don't miss the ceviche, guacamole and churros. The cocktails too are pretty interesting and well-balanced. Not to mention, one of the best open-air views of the Petronas Twin Towers and KL Tower! They are popular, so be sure to make a reservation or risk disappointment."
0,Jeff G.,Fuego,"We ate here while vacationing in Kuala Lumphur. A tapas restaurant in Malaysia??? Yep, and I recommend it. I've eaten in tapas restaurants in L.A., Las Vegas and of course Spain, and Fuego holds its own. The menu doesn't have a lot of tapas selections, but certainly enough to make dinner a wonderful experience. The fried watermelon and cheese was delish. And they also serve up a spicy mohito that was great! Service was excellent. The only drawback was the building and restaurant were undergoing major construction projects. While dining we were hit with a huge thunderstorm. This is an outdoor restaurant on the 23rd floor for the most part. All us diners had to move as far back into the restaurant as possible and even then we were getting some of the storm on us. Lightening strikes everywhere across the city, including on the twin towers. My response was to have another mojito. When we got our bill (very reasonable) and I was happy to see the restaurant didn't charge extra for the storm."
0,Naiying C.,Pelita Brasserie,"We walked here from our hotel for brunch. The menu is huge! The buttered roti is a must eat but beware of the seafood because it's market price. We got about 7 large shrimps and that was 130 something rm, quite pricey in masia standards. The milk tea is also really good!"
0,Emme M.,Al-Andalus,"Dining at Al-Andalus is always a pleasure. For alone diners, I don't really recommend it unless you're familiar with a big portion. The food is good and can be considered as cheap when I usually split the portion in half. A Mix Grill (Chicken and Lamb variation with a portion of rice) will cost you around RM32. The drinks is slightly expensive but you can always settled on a Barbican

The offer shisha as well. The shisha is a lot cheaper and tasted good too. The one thing that I like it here is the ambience. The middle eastern feeling and decorations make you feel like you're some place else."
0,Sue F.,Al-Andalus,"Al-Andalus is my favourite place to have Middle Eastern food. I've been here no less than 50 times now and it's consistent every single time. My favourite things to order are the hummus topped with minced lamb, lamb tagine, lamb mandi and fattoush salad. Oh, and the Moroccan mint tea is so good to wash everything down.

The service here is really good too. It's rare for a place where the food is so cheap to have such attentive and personalised attention, but everyone's really friendly and accommodating which is what matters. If you come late at night, they might play live coverage of sports on the suspended TVs, but it might get a bit loud from all the excited fans.

The place is still largely unknown to a lot of people who work in KL but I like it that way because every time I recommend Al-Andalus to a friend, they're always pleasantly surprised."
0,Kevin W.,Al-Andalus,"Have you tried Moroccan food?

Well Al-Andalus is the place where you can find decent Middle-Eastern cuisine.
The place is tentatively pack at nights and is usually a hangout spot after a night of clubbing and alcohol.
At the same time, there's shisha here and it goes at an affordable price. They have tons of flavours and their house specialty.

What pulled me in was their food. Their couscous and lamb shank is amazing. The meat is tender and soft, while the couscous goes together with the sauce.

I have not tried the other dishes but I do hope to go back there again to have a jolly good feast."
0,Kris A.,Restaurant Sun Huat Kee,"I'll definitely be here again. The service is superb and the food is delicious. I wasn't certain which to order and the staff was so patient explaining everything to me, from the ingredients to how they put together the various dishes! Then when I collect my food, he reminded me to get Chilli, tissues, etc. I'm so impressed!!!  Best part of this is, the dishes ate served on ceramic bowls and real utensils - not disposables."
0,Simina I.,Le Midi,"I've been here once on a date with a Italian guy. He decided to take me here, because the restaurant in specialised in Italian and French cuisine. The restaurant has also and amazing view of the KL skyline, so if you decide to go here you have to reserve a table by the window or outside on the terrace.

Once we ordered the food I was happy that we didn't have to wait long time for it.
The food was both excellently presented with an excellent quality, feeling like I'm in a 5 star hotel restaurant. The real surprise was when the dessert came and it truly made my day.

They have also a nice wine selections, imported from Italy and France.

The staff was professional with their delivery of service and they created a value added service which is quite short coming now days."
0,Alexandra M.,Le Midi,"Welcome to Le Midi, restaurant and wine bar with a French/Italian taste.

Do you want to feel like you are in Marseille enjoying some french cuisine? Or perhaps sipping some Italian wine in the Veneto region? Well you can do both of those here.

You can start with some garlic prawns for RM29, maybe even have some mushroom soup or a Mediterranean salad (RM28/RM18) before your Cod au Vin is prepared (RM78). And if your appetite is still up for some sweets you can end your delicious meal with a Chantilly millefoglie with caramel or a Classic crème brulee or perhaps a French Kiss Souffle :)

Suffice to say that the options are limitless and so should your budget be. They also offer Italian or French 4 course set meals around RM178 per person."
0,Sin Yee Y.,Le Midi,"Le Midi Restaurant is a fine dining restaurant which serves their valued customers with French/Italian cuisine. Perhaps you have not heard of Le Midi before, but it was absolutely worth to dine at. It executive chef, Chef Andrea Alimenti, who is a multiple Michelin star chef. I bet foodie lover knows about Michelin star chef. It is the highest honor for chef to receive Michelin star as their achievement. Chef Andre has worked more than 30 years in the culinary area. He owns his restaurant; yet, he is now serving us in Le Midi, just because he want to learn more about our local cuisine. His enthusiasm in culinary is highly appreciated.

I went to Le Midi Restaurant in my birthday last year. It was my first fine dining restaurant, to be honest, I was nervous; at the meantime, I was happy. The restaurant was silent at the afternoon, there was only one or two persons dined in when we reached. The interior design is definitely classic and beautiful.

We brought our red wine, which need a charge of RM100. The crews were polite. They were attentive. I believed they were well-trained because they know all the table manners and how to serve the customers. However, the lady boss wasn't as friendly as her staffs. I think it actually affects the impression she gave to the customers.

We ordered our main course. The tomato soup was served after ordering. It was fresh, the aroma was able to trigger my taste buds. Meanwhile, a bun was served too. It was hard in outer layer, yet soft in inside. Coated a thin layer of butter, it was heavenly delicious. Following by our main course, the grilled augus rib eye was tender. My dear told me it was the most delicious rib eye he has had so far. While my grilled chicken with barbecue sauce, same, it was tender and less oily. Since my dear told them it was my birthday, Le Midi gave us a complimentary dessert with birthday greeting on plates. It was a very pleasant dining at Le Midi. Although it was an expensive lunch, it worth more than it. Too bad Chef Andrea was not in that day, hope I can meet him in the next visit."
0,Clara S.,Heun Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"One of the best Chinese Claypot Chicken Rice I've had so far. Generous bits of chicken, Chinese 'lap Cheong's sausage slices. Sauce was plenty enough to flavour the rice. Bottom was not overly burnt but nicely crisp.

Go early and watch them making these lovely meals right outside. It is a scene to witness with the fans blowing at the many Claypots lined out front. Would so have it again if not for the experience!"
0,Lydia L.,Heun Kee Claypot Chicken Rice,"Big portions. Generous rice servings and reasonably priced. The place is fairly clean and air conditioned. For take away, do call at least half an hour earlier."
0,Francis T.,Satay Station,"Very good meat, tender and flavorful. Generous portions. Authentic and typical satay. Nice and quiet surrounding to sit and relax during your meal with Indoor and outdoor seating.
I will definitely come back."
0,Jyn-Mun N.,Satay Station,"Satay Station is the typical Malaysian restaurant, which sells Malaysian delights. However, they only sell Satay, Mee Rebus, Nasi Goreng and drinks, so you have limited choices. The satay meat is big, chunky and good quality meat, but the price per stick is RM1.80, which is ultra expensive for satay in Malaysia! The Mee Rebus tasted too sweet for me too and the apple juice was very pricey and they added a lot of ice, so basically I was paying for ice instead of apple juice."
0,Diana C.,Pappa Rich,"This is a very traditional restaurant in KL. It has been around for years and it has many outlets across the city.

They specialize in traditional Malaysian food, and everything I've tried there was extremely tasty. They also have a Wester menu which I don't like as much as their local options. I particularly like their noodles.

Their service is okay and the price is not unreasonable which is good I guess. I recommend stopping by for some genuine local food."
0,Ash H.,Pappa Rich,"I wouldn't bother reviewing Pappa Rich outlets but I really like this one. It is located at the alfresco area on the ground floor of Nu Sentral, which actually overlooks Jalan Tun Sambathan (the Tun Sambathan entrance to Nu Sentral is on LG floor). The interior is great, food is pretty standard, and service is pretty good.

For those looking for a place to have casual meetings, or a place with decent coffee and WiFi to do some work out of the office, this has become my go-to place in Nu Sentral. I have tried out a few other places for this purpose, such as Simply D, Starbucks, and the Pappa Rich's neighbouring cafes, but I have found this to be the best mix of comfort, good WiFi (hasn't failed me and it's my 4th time here), good local coffee, and food.

Let's hope this place maintains the good service and good WiFi."
0,Carl C.,Pappa Rich,"Food was good but Yelp has to update the directions on the map. We came from Islamic Arts Museum at Jalan Lembah Perdana and yelp told us it was short walking distance away. We followed the direction and it pointed to a different place, upon checking google map, this was far,  that we had to take a cab to get there."
0,Lucie B.,Ciao Ristorante,"Ciao is definitely one of the nicest restaurants I've been to in KL. It's gorgeous, rustic interior creates the perfect scene for a date or group dinner.
Between my boyfriend and I we had the rocket salad, lobster pasta, spinach and ricotta ravioli in sage butter sauce, orange creme brulee and tiramisu at the cost of 220RM.
Our entire meal was stand out, delicious and full of Italian flavor.
We were not let down on the quality here and will gladly return again and again."
0,Jen L.,Ciao Ristorante,"I first came here when i was still a college student not branching into events yet, i  never knew how important it is for a good location, however, when i first came in to this location, my partner send me here which was so nice of him.

As i entered, there was a space for parking and there was a registration table waiting for me. It was pretty packed with people. As  i entered, there was the bartender constantly pouring drinks for the guest and on my left side, there was a room with Samsung Products ( It was during the Samsung S4 camera launch). As i entered the small room, all Samsung products and some nice photos posted up on the wall and some where hanging all taken by Samsung.

When i went back out and went deeper, seats was already all set up and a platform ready to begin, Around me are all buffet tables with amazing finger food and as i step outside, beautiful golf coast and over my center was KLCC.

I love this place and  i didn't thought that this venue could be so important to me to keep some pictures as  i am writing this.

Amazing space, though be careful of lighting if you want to do night event and amazing set ups."
0,Angeline C.,Ciao Ristorante,"Planning to have a intimate wedding with just your closest friends and family member? Plus if you are a Italian food lovers who wants to enjoy these Italian food as fine dining should really drop by this restaurant and have a look.

it is not a big restaurant but it is a place for people who wants to have event's like engagement party or wedding, I been here for two times and believe me their food is just so good I can't rate it in such average way, I rate it as 9 out of 10!"
0,Julie Y.,Ciao Ristorante,"This Italian establishment has built a reputation for itself as a popular events and wedding venue thanks to its large space area. Complimentary parking is available inside the grounds and it can usually accommodate quite a lot of cars. If you're coming to this restaurant for the first time, it may be easy to miss this place as it is off jalan tun razak along a few other restaurants but the signboard is a little difficult to spot as well. I ordered a taxi once and the driver got lost as he couldn't find the restaurant.

The restaurant has various private rooms which can be turned into a place for events and it also has an outdoor seating area that faces the royal selangor golf course. Italian cuisine is served here and i've found their food to be on the safe side as their tiramisu and pasta is usually quite decent. The outdoor area makes quite a nice place for wedding pictures and can accommodate a large amount of guests.  Unfortunately reservations have to be done in advance to secure the place as it is popular."
0,Wye Mun K.,Ciao Ristorante,"Discovered this place back when I was interning in an agency and went for a lunch appointment. This place has a damn good ambiance I must say and I love their seating area outside which you can actually see the Petronas Twin Towers.

Food here has been great as well, they serve mainly Italian dishes so if you're a fan of Italian place and looking for a good view to bring your date to, Ciao Ristorante is the place to go to.

0,Amirul R.,Ciao Ristorante,"Very fancy, very lovely... It's not at all where you might expect to find one of the nicest meals in KL. I'm pretty sure this is the perfect date night location, especially for older diners who appreciate great service, great food and a more traditional Italian ambience. The weekday lunch promo at RM52 for a three course meal sounds unbelievable!"
0,Amirul R.,Spazio Restaurant,"A wonderfully convenient place to get really authentic Middle Eastern dishes deep in Pantai. You know they've got it right when they attract diners from that part of the world, missing delicious dishes from the homeland. Dishes range from as cheap as RM4 all the way to RM30 or so, with typical fare such as falafel and shawarma and mandi - but also more experimental options like Mexican fajitas too. The drinks menu comprises familiar Malaysian beverages like sirap ais.

Why I love this place? Late, late hours (the late night shisha crowd means this place regularly stays open until 1 or 2am every night) as well as a speedy delivery service, very useful for those in Centrio, Pantai Hillpark or Bangsar South!"
0,Nat P.,Leaf & Co. Cafe,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
I Ordered the ""cheezella"" and the ""jumbo chicken kebab sticks"" for 38Malaysian!
Can honestly say they are the best kebabs I've had. The chicken was so juicy and flavoursome! And the meatballs were also extremely juicy with lots of flavour!
Even better the food came out in 5-10 minutes.
Tip (If you stay at the mingle hostel you get 20% off)
So make sure you make the most of that"
0,Alfie C.,The Humble Chef Food Truck,"Being humble is a virtue and hard to do when you are making a damn good food. Luckily, The Humble Chef manages to pull that one out.

This famous food truck is selling some good pastas at an affordable price. The Aglio Olio is just for RM5. Do you guys believe that ? We all know that we should pay more for something good but trust me, there's nothing that not good about their pasta other than the plating. As for me I don't care about the plating as the food tastes this good.

I'm willing to hunt for this food truck till the end of the world."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,The Humble Chef Food Truck,"If you're up for something new with an Italian twist, hop over the Humble Chef Food Truck, not literally unless you know how to drive one.

If you have never been to Humble Chef, they are known for serving western food for a extremely inexpensive price of RM5 for main courses and RM2.50 for sandwiches.

Surprisingly not too bad on the quality either.

Serving the same menu as their restaurant at Jalan Media Setia, it's just an improvised version. Offering quicker service since it's more of a direct interaction with their customers.

Going with the lamb theme, I had a lamb omelet, lamb pita, and a chicken cabonara. Total damage? RM15. The portion size is appropriately matched with the price tag. Nothing too fancy, just a taste of Italian food at its least.

There is nothing much to say about the food, average taste but I will have to say that the cabonara was seasoned well!"
0,Bryan S.,The Humble Chef Food Truck,"What the Humble Chef offers that truly distinguishes itself from the rest, is its price. At Rm5 for all their pasta dishes, and RM2.50 for their sandwiches, I'd be dumbfounded if you could find western food anywhere else with such good value, very humble indeed. My wallet owes great thanks to many late night suppers spent here, knowing that for under RM15 I'd definitely would be able to get my fill with no complaints. They're huge success on the streets has led to the opening of their own café in Bukit Damansara, though I've yet to venture there, I hear the menu and prices are identical to their mobile counterpart. Call me a creature of habit but I personally still enjoy dining outside their parked van along the bridge"
0,Rose K.,One Seafood Restaurant,"Excellent service.  Very fresh fish.
Our local host brought our team here.  Everything ordered was delicious.    
It was not very busy at 7:30 pm on a Sunday.  

Very much enjoyed the meal !"
0,Vanessa O.,Restoran Malaya Hainan,"Hainanese cuisine is famous in the early days of Kuala Lumpur around in the 1970s, and why it is so famous? The food is simply delicious! Located near Petaling Street, this restaurant has its first outlet in Jalan Panggong, Kuala Lumpur - walking distance from Jalan Tun HS Lee, or even the Pasar Seni LRT Station.

The building is a two storey building where by the second floor is entirely built up using wood - just like houses during the colonial era of Malaysia. All the wooden windows are like an art to me! The entire building (both interior and exterior) is like the olden houses of the Chinese clan - very traditional and beautiful!!! If you like antiques, you should come here to fill up your photo albums.

Service is excellent as they are prompt and helpful. Food wise - they have an extensive set of Malaysian food as well as the Hainanese cuisines to offer. Price wise - reasonable! Overall, I do like this place as it reminds me a little about dining in Coliseum, except for having a meal in a Chinese way."
0,Al D.,Li Yen,Nice Chinese Restaurant.  There is a dim sum menu and a regular menu.  I loved the pictures of the Chinese women on the wall.  Food was pretty good.
0,Josephine N.,Cava,"Their Sangria, OMG!! YUMMY!!!!!!! Love it and to top it all off, we had the Chocolate Lava cake too. GOSH! It was so good!! This is one place I'll definitely come back again!! Without a doubt."
0,Sue F.,Restoran ZK,"Have you seen fish heads as big as yours? At Restoran ZK, it's highly likely you will. This corner shop in Kampung Attap is known for fish head curry. They cook a giant batch every day and display it in this massive container where you can see fish heads bobbing on curry. You then have to pick the head you want and additional sides.

The fish head comes with little flesh but most people like to eat the cheeks, fins and even the eyeballs. It's hard for me to stomach everything, but the tables around me don't usually see it as a problem. If I'm not in the mood to splash (one head can go up to RM90), I usually just help myself to the curry alone with rice and vegetables. The honey fried chicken is pretty good too - sticky, sweet and crunchy at the same time.  

One of the downsides here is the poor service. I don't know if it's because of how busy the restaurant gets or whether it's understaffed. But I usually take a long time to get the waiter's attention, especially when sitting in the outdoor area."
0,Muhi L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,Probably the best nasi lemak in klang valley. It's typically  very busy throughout the day the usual wait time can be about 45 mins
0,Sarah P.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Village Park is infamous by now. From the Prime Minister stopping here for Nasi Lemak, to locals and expats and everyone in-between. We stopped here and ordered their fish with Kangkung, Nasi Lemak, watermelon juice, and Onde Onde dessert.
I am addicted to Malaysia's national dish and am a major fan of so many different versions of it. The version at Village Park is served with crunchy fried chicken and a flavorful sambal sauce.

Super yummy and I certainly will return when in the area. If you can handle a crowd and have some patience you'll love it also"
0,Matt L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Service aside, hands down the best Nasi lemak I have ever had and to this day still is.

For around RM 10, you can get a plate of their infamous Nasi Lamak, coming with a drumstick, rice, sambal chilli, and the hard boiled egg.

This restaurant is usually packed anytime of the day you go! Tell someone you want to sit at a table and they will usually direct you - usually outside or inside on the 1st floor or the 2nd floor up the stairs which is a little quieter.

After enjoying your meal, you'll take your check to the front to pay. Don't let that fool you when you walk in as this isn't the line to put your name down.

You will not be disappointed by this place. Every time I come to KL, I always tell my relatives to take me here as this is one of my favorite meals in SE Asia."
0,Lori H.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Nasi Lemak is a famous dish in this country. It is like Malaysia all in one plate. I'm so glad my aunt brought me to this local place because the dish was so so good here. I wish I could go back and have this dish over and over again. Needless to say, this has to be one of my favorite dishes while I was in KL. The chicken was moist, crispy, flavorful and the coconut rice was perfect. The famous white coffee was great for the morning time as well.

Service was good and fast. They prepare so many plates of the Nasi Lemak on a side serving table ready for the rush. It was great because I didn't have to wait long for anything. I loved everything about this restaurant."
0,Horton L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"This restaurant is a must when you find yourself in Kuala Lumpur. I'd recommend coming here for their national dish- Nasi Lemak. No one else does it better than them.

The nasi lemak is deliciously amazing-  crispy fried skin on the outside and juicy tender chicken on the inside. The juice literally squirted out of my teeth when I took the first bite- I'm salivating all over my cordless phone right now just thinking about it. And the rice- OMG! The rice tasted like it was cooked in fresh coconut water, it came wrapped in pandan leaf. The fragrant is hard to describe- you will need to experience it yourself. Do yourself a favor and have plenty for breakfast. I guarantee you will fall in love with it. Ask for their sambal (chill sauce, 50c extra), if you mix it with the rice it is delicious!

It is tucked away in a strip mall type of restaurants and it's close to a big modern mall and many small local businesses, it is also in a mid- high end residential area so you def feel safe. so it's not bad to come here for a meal then walk off that extra calories in the surrounding area- to explore what the local life is like."
0,Dennis D.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Village Park is a local landmark nasi lemak shop in Damansara Uptown- quite a distance from Kuala Lumpur City Center. It's so good though that even the previous and current PM's have made visits.

No visit to Malaysia would be complete without trying nasi lemak as least once- it's the national dish! You can get it almost anywhere- mall, hawker, mamak, roadside; this place has the best one I've had though. Before you dig in, take a moment and smell the aromatic fragrance of this dish to truly appreciate its greatness. The rice is rich, but not too rich, with santan (coconut milk), and mixed with the sambal, ikan bilis, and peanuts for a crunchy, nuttier texture on the side make all the complex tastes balance out and come fully together. The deep-fried chicken is also cooked to a perfect crisp. And while you're here, wash it down with some teh tarik.

Yelp isn't really a thing in Malaysia, so I'm surprised that there's 50+ reviews of this place. The parking situation in this area is an expected shit show, and there's always a long wait due to popular demand. There's a dabao (takeout) line, but to eat-in, you have to wait/fight for a table and someone will come up and take your orders. If I didn't care about eating clean, I'd come here every other day. Aside from family, nasi lemak makes me miss Malaysia even more."
0,Timothy G.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,The nasi lemak is OK. It's overhyped really. There isn't an option for no peanuts with your ikan bilis or just the drumstick on the fried chicken.
0,Kammy F.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"So yummy on the fried chicken.  Juicy and crispy and the seasoning cuts down the grease from the fried chicken. It's had hard to imagine a ""refresh fried chicken"" in my mind but it's how it is.  I'm not a fried chicken fan at all but it's going to be my fried chicken dish in my future. Everything is so fresh and even the peanut is going well with the coconut rice."
0,Anchisa P.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,Famous Nasi Lemak store in KL. The nasi lemak is good as famed though not the best I have had. The chicken was crispy though a bit dry. Rice is fragrant and sambal provides a nice contrast. Large portion at reasonable price. Lots of people (though restaurant is quite big so the wait is usually not long).
0,Andrea W.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"I absolutely loved this place when I went back in January this year. The line to the restaurant was really long and my friend waited for about half an hour for the five of us. I ordered a plate of nasi lemak as well as a tea, and it was delicious. The chicken was juicy and really flavorful, and the rice was well-cooked and perfectly chewy. The flavors of everything was so delicious, and the chicken was freshly fried so it was still hot. It was a great meal, and I highly recommend it!"
0,Lucy Y.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"After seeing a Youtube video about this restaurant, we came here for an early lunch on a Sunday.  The take away line was really long, and the tables were packed.  Within a few minutes, we scored a table, & our orders arrived quickly after that.  

We got the Nasi Lemak with Ayam Goreng (fried chicken) - omg.  The fried chicken skin is crunchy & infused with lemongrass, and the crispy bits of it that are sprinkled on too of the juicy meat takes it to another level of delicious.  The sambal is spicy, and the peanuts and little fried fish accent the coconutty fluffy rice perfectly.  A half of a boiled egg comes with it too.

Once you take the first bite of that chicken, you understand why its the best nasi lemak ever.

We also tried the kaya toast & the fresh rice noodles, and they were good too - but come here for that chicken & rice!"
0,Jia L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"One of the best nasi lemak in town- used to be better about 10 years ago though. But since we can't turn back time, this will have to do. The fried chicken nasi lemak is a clear winner. Make sure you ask for extra crispy bits. The sambal is a little spicy and not to sweet. I think they charge 80c for an extra portion.

The service is swift but not friendly. It's pretty much their way or the highway. The place isn't too clean either."
0,Clarence J.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"(This is probably closer to 4.5 stars to me.)  As advertised, the nasi lemak with ayam goreng here was awesome to me, with just the right balance of flavors.  I don't like anchovies, but the anchovies here, while flavorful and noticeable, weren't overpowering, and I finally saw how they work in this dish.

Village Park is a good-sized, bustling place toward one end of the street that fronts The Starling Mall.  Despite it being a good size, be prepared to share part of your long or circular table table with other diners.  The restaurant's well-worn and a little sticky everywhere, but it's alright.  The corner in which we sat smelled sort of musty or like a wet animal before our food arrived, but the flavors of the food took care of that (or I got used to it).

From what I've heard and observed, the ordering practice here apparently depends on situation: sometimes you order as you pass the kitchen area and then sit, while other times you sit and then order from the waiter -- in either case, you pay at the front on your way out.

I'm sure I'll eat here again."
0,Lai A.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"This is the best Nasi Lemak in Malaysia ! Rice + Fried Chicken and The condiments plus the Sambal are to die for . Pretty hard to get a seat @ weekends and lunch times, but it's worth the wait ! You wouldn't be disappointed . P/S - Do not expect the ""Malaysian Hospitality"" here , I took away 2 Stars coz of their staff impatient-ness since they are Number 1"
0,YM C.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Sambal is good..its not sweet, fried chicken aromatic and moist, generally good food but not good space to hangout...very noisy."
0,Yasmin H.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Best Nasi Lemak in Kl hands down. Many love the fried chicken - but it only comes in a drumstick.
The rendang is great, but sambal is fantastic !"
0,Karmen N.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,really crowded and busy place! Food came reasonably quickly as their rice dish is the most popular.  the rice is nice and coconuty and the chicken is so crispy and flavourful.  it's quite filling and delicious!
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"When I see a place being really crowded all the times, I tend to think that they must be overrated. I always think of this place this way but every single time when I have their sambal, I got reminded yet again for why they are so demanded. Perfect sambal, fragrant but never too oily or moist rice and the fresh batches of fried chicken, these are quite a combination.

Prices aren't exactly cheap here, but the portion of the fried chicken (if you are having that with your nasi lemak) is really quite big, so you don't feel that you are getting ripped off.

Apart from the signature dish here, they do serve quite a wide range of noodles and kuih-muihs here as well. You could always ask for the options from the waiters here.

Parking here is always difficult, and a lot of people do double park here. You are definitely doing it on your own risk though, as you might not just get a summon, car towing is pretty common in this area too! So, be careful about that!

Crowded, but love it, and always think that it's worth it after each re-visit."
0,Wei Jie L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Came here to taste the hype. I had the popular Nasi Lemak + Fried Chicken combo. Definitely was not disappointed, but can't say that it's otherworldly. Just like what most people already knew, this place gets PACKED! They do have air-conditioned indoor seating. But you need to walk in all the way to the end, squeeze past the folks lining up to get food and to pay, and make a right.

Despite the hype and the patronage of celebrities, the price is still very reasonable. I will definitely go back and try their other stuffs."
0,Dedris L.,Village Park Nasi Lemak,"Come to right place to taste a good Nasi Lemak, avoid busy meal times. Bit pricey than normal vendors around the area, but for the ingredients and taste, the place is not to be avoided"
0,Ian L.,La Boca,"Drinking in a shopping mall seems to be a trend within KL-ites. Afterall, we do everything in the mall, don't we?
  We like La Boca for different reasons. First, drinking here doesn't make you feel like you're stuck in a mall. The vibrant, colorful setting of the bar, said to be inspired by of seaport town in Bueno Aires, makes the atmosphere very lively.
We also like the Latin dishes as much as we like the drinks. The La Boca Explosion and Tequila Bombs are the bomb! But our favorites are definitely the frozen Margaritas and their own variations of caipirinhas. On certain nights, they even have people doing Salsa dances. Esta loca!"
0,Hardew K.,La Boca,"The service is excellent.
Food are great.
Lively ambience.
Selection of music is really good.
Would love to come again and recommend to friends to come here."
0,Clarence J.,La Boca,"La Boca has a large menu of Latin American foods from up and down the Americas.  What I've tried has been pretty good.  All the expected flavors were there, although I'd prefer a little more depth of flavor; it seemed like the flavors didn't fully blend together to give the boldness I generally find in Latin American food.  The chili con carne was a positive standout though.  On the other end, I really wasn't pleased with the frozen margarita I had, finding it to be ridiculously salty -- there was no salt on the rim, so it was throughout the mix.

The staff is friendly and feeds a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  Decorated like an outdoor neighborhood cafe, the restaurant becomes even more lively when there's live music."
0,David S.,La Boca,"This restaurant is so noisy that I can't taste the food. It's a shame because the food looks so tasty. But I do like their Caipirinha.

The noise originates from some huge extraction fans in the mall."
0,Ruebni K.,La Boca,"Tried their sorrentinos, basically ravioli with stuffef ham and cheese. Quite delicious and super filling.

Husband had the fajitas and you can request to customize it to your preference. He asked for really spicy and it the best fajitas dish so far

Tried their Dulce Le leche cake. Delish!  

The portions are quite big so my advice is to share.

Very cozy place with music that makes you wish to get up and dance salsa. Friendly staff. Then again you are paying additional 10 % for the service.

Price is standard for pavilion restaurants,  which means average RM40 a dish."
0,Nicole S.,La Boca,"La Boca is such a fun restaurant to dine at. I've only been to the Pavilion outlet and I absolutely loved it! The deco is so pretty and colorful, if you look at it from the outside you'd be so tempted to try it out. La Boca claims to have the best fajitas in KL so of course we had to try it for ourselves. To be fair it was very nice and flavorful, my mum and boyfriend loved it. I on the other hand still think Las Carettas has the best fajitas. We also had a spicy mexican pizza with jalapeños. Now this was something different and very yummy too, till you accidentally bite a huge chunk of jalapeño!

The first time i ate here was when we were on a date night so it was a friday and the atmosphere at the restaurant was simply amazing. They had a live band, which consisted of a man and a woman, he played the keyboard while she sang, traditional latino music that is. The best part was that many couples got up to dance to the music albeit the very packed restaurant; the waiters had to swerve around the dancing duos to get to the tables! Long story short, it was a wonderful night that I'm not gonna forget anytime soon. The prices are reasonable too, it came to about rm87 for a pizza, and fajitas."
0,Annabelle Y.,La Boca,"It's hard to find a good Mexican restaurant here, especially one that exudes the vibe that this Spanish speaking continent is known for. La boca does this plus the colorful decor makes for a truly great experience! La Boca is actually named after a seaport town in Buenos Aires, bet you didn't know that=) I've been to this place a couple of times, mostly for their Caipirinhas, which has a tangy bite but smooth on the palate. Of course, the food is on par as well. Try the Cuban sandwich - turkey, cheese, mustard relish - simple yet filling. Or if you are looking at something hearty, try their famous fajitas, basically stir fried meat, peppers, Mexican spices and a dash of lime, served with warm tortillas, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. Very comforting indeed! Try the pizzas if you visit in a large group, I bet they will be delicious too!"
0,Globe T.,La Boca,"We wanted some Latin food and wanted to give this place a try. The ambience is not too bad; has a Mexican outdoor feel to it. The drinks are way too heavy on the alcohol side. It totally masks away the rest of the other flavors for a cocktail. We tried a few things. The ceviche was actually the saving grace of all the things we ordered. Their self-proclaimed ""best tacos"" were mediocre at best. The jalapeño poppers has too much batter and made it a little too hard to enjoy fully. You can give it a try if you are really really craving Latin food. If not, I would suggest you look for something else to satisfy your hunger."
0,Azraai A.,La Boca,"What first attracted me to La Boca was the colorful interior. It was ridiculous (in a good way.) Being an authentic Latin bistro, you could aspect splashed of deep reds and oranges across the walls, paintings in vibrant yellows, and purples and reds and greens...simply magnificent. It was so good I almost broke into a full mambo routine.

The menu was designed to look like a newspaper or a quarterly magazine and boasted an array of authentic Latin dishes, enough to make any normal human salivate with delight. I opted for the Pizza Rallena.

Now let me tell you a little about the experience I had with this dish. Have you ever been in love? Yes...That...Its beautiful (baked until the outside crusts were a beautiful shade of golden brown,) its mysterious (you cant really see the topping of the pizza as its is enveloped by an outer shell,) its addictive (you cant just have one, even if you're full, you would still want another slice) and its scary (the thought of what two of those would do to my waist.)

I question myself whether I will ever try another dish off the menu, but I guess I'm just an old fashioned monogamist."
0,Michelle C.,Tian Yian Cafe & Restaurant,"Taman Miharja is not the first place one would picture as the location of what is possibly the best chinese vegetarian restaurant in the Klang Valley. Newcomers often miss the entrance signboard when looking for it.

Tian Yian offers ample seating, but even then, on weekends this place is packed to the brim and I totally understand why. Their food is awesome. Even for a meat eater like me, this place is living proof that a meal can be meat free and yet really delicious. I recommend anyone eating at this place for the first time to try their vegetarian satay and green curry rice.

They also have a great selection of vegan cakes that come in a myriad of flavours. Since its vegetarian,meaning that it is meat and alcohol free, this restaurant is ideal for mixed groups of muslims and their non-muslims friends to chill and enjoy chinese food."
0,Hayden L.,Vasco's,"Thanks to my chef friend, we got to try out the Hilton's  buffet. The buffet was served at Vasco's, a restaurant designed with an ""al fresco"" feel and it's spacious enough to seat a lot of starving eaters.The buffet was really Impressive with wide selection of Asian and international favorites.
The food was really freeesh! I love the sushi bar particularly. The salmon sashimi is fresh and they cut it into thick pieces, it was really satisfying. It was good to eat it on its own or dipped it in the Japanese soy sauce and wasabi. My personal favorite was to sprinkle some of that expensive cute pinkish rock salt in it and let it melt in my mouth, it was heavenly.  Besides salmon sashimi, there was other type of sashimi too but too bad I didn't know the names. Regardless, they are all delicious. 10 points for the amazing sushi bar!
For those who love seafood, Vasco's  does have a good variety of seafood. There was tiger shrimp, mussels on ice, crabs, oyster! They are super fresh and I love oysters! Buffet is the only time where I can feast on unlimited oysters, a little bit of lemon drizzle and Tabasco sauce is good to go.  For a more bellyful option, we also took some roasted rib-eye with spinach & olive oil, peppered duck breast in balsamic berry sauce & lasagna. I love the chicken piece cooked in the pot, it was so savory & the chicken was cooked to juicy. There was also a chef on standby to cut us some medium-rare beef & freshly made thin-crust pizzas, God knows how many cows I ate yesterday. However, liquors at Vasco's are costly (wine starts at RM43++, go by the glass) so if you are tight on budget, I would suggest to finish the meal first & head onto the bar available in Hilton.
I would totally recommend Vasco's at Hilton!
Dinner starts at 6.30 pm to 10.30 pm
Monday till Thursday   Adult: RM128++
                                   Child: RM 64++
Friday till Sunday   Adult: RM 135++
                                  Child: RM 67.50++"
0,Jeff L.,Vasco's,"Plentiful of choices!! If you're guest of hotel, I will recommended you take your breakfast earlier, it's start at 6:30am, and I get there at 7:30am it's already people mountain people sea, had to say, their restaurant got a really nice decor but crawled space."
0,Trena M.,Dancing Fish,"Love this place for Malay/Indonesian food!

We ordered the udang baker and the ayam rendang set. I wish I took a picture because the presentation was really nice! I'm not a huge prawn fan, but it didn't taste or smell too fishy. The rendang set was such a good deal! For about 30rm you get enough to feed 2 people for lunch. It came with 2 huge pieces of chicken, 2 types of rice, 3 veggies, emping and tempeh! The rendang was super flavorful, you could definitely taste the kaffir lime flavor. I loved that they serve 2 types of rice also. This is a really good place to introduce people to Indonesian food. The decor inside is really cute too"
0,Fitfun F.,Dancing Fish,"Singing wait staff? Crunchy fried fish, deep fried bean curd, moist duck and paku vegetables in lukewarm turmeric sauce. Malay-Indonesia archipelago cooking. Dark heavy kampung wood decor. Nice change to culinary experience. The fish tails & bones fried so crunchy you could eat it like a cracker. Good experience for first times to the Mal-Indo cuisine. Beware the innocent looking sauces. Packing chili padi after shocks."
0,Eveline L.,Dancing Fish,"Dancing Fish is an Indonesian Malay restaurant which is also located in Setia City Mall other than BSC. Decor here is modern and the restaurant feels pretty comfortable.

Their signature dish is the dancing fish with sambal terasi with kicap. Presentation of the dish is BEAUTIFUL! The fish looked like it is in a dancing pose. The fish is deep fried and you can eat it with the kicap provided. Fish was super crispy and the sauce was good. The other dishes we had however, was just okay.

Price wise, it is quite steep especially with the portions being more on the small side."
0,Alexandra M.,Dancing Fish,"Looking for some local cuisine? Look no more. Dancing fish combines Indo food with the Malay one. The restaurant is proud of being in top 20 restaurant in Kl with a feature in CNNGO.

As the name says it, their specialty is the dancing fish. Which you have to try as it is a but hard to explain what it is all about. But don't worry, the fish is cooked, it will not dance in your plate :)

Their food is pretty tasty and if you want to treat your family out for dinner, they even have a kids menu. Another things they offer that I haven't seen in a lot of place is duck so if you want to try something different do check them out.

The place is pretty busy and popular so remember to make a reservation before you head over."
0,Mi Yen F.,Dancing Fish,"In conjunction with my colleague's farewell and also the boss's pre-birthday celebration, colleagues and I decided to celebrate the occasions at Dancing Fish - a Malay Indon cuisine restaurant located within the affluent, upscale walls of BSC.

As its name sake, it's signature dish was THE Dancing Fish. Crispy on the outside and deliciously steamy on the inside, the fish was served with an elegant ""swimming pose"". Not quite what you'd be expecting a standard fish ready to eat to look like (as in flat on the dish plate!). I was quite the impressed customer when the dish was first served!

As it was my first time to an authentic, high class Indonesian restaurant, I did find the names of the dishes funny. But names aside,  the food was really filling! Other than the dancing fish, I quite enjoyed the satay and tofu dish served there too. The dessert of the night was some Indonesian jelly with lemon grass. Not something I was used to. I much prefer their main course as compared to their desserts.

All in all, good food, good service, good ambience. Just make sure you're prepared with lots of moolah or your credit card when coming here!"
0,Simina I.,Dancing Fish,"I have to say that Dancing Fish is one of my favourite restaurants in KL! The serve Indonesian cuisine mixed with the Malay one. The menu is diverse and offers lots of choice with outstanding flavours

The restaurant is a good place for family dinner and of course for couples. But you need to know that the restaurant is quite noisy since located in BSC ( Bangsar Shopping Centre) where lot's of people passed by. So if  you are looking for a place with quite ambiance, you may have to find another place.

The food is consistently tasty with a great variety or dishes and well presented. Besides their famous 'dancing fish' which one must order, I tried their satay ,with I love because there are very succulent and makes you crave for more. If you will order the signature of the house, you have to have it with sweet soya sauce

The staff here is ok, but they lack on detail....a little.

P.S. If you like Indonesian/Malay food, you will love it here, but best make a reservation to ensure you have a table"
0,Diana C.,Dancing Fish,"One of the best ambiances in the BSC area. This restaurant is simply beautiful!

I had heard wonders about Indonesian food but had never tried before, until I went to the dancing fish. I confess I was a bit suspicious when people told me that this could be one of the best Indonesian restaurants in town.

I haven't had any other Indonesian food to compare but I can definitely say I had a great experience at the dancing fish. Since I didn't really know what to order I had to count on the waiters advice to choose something that tasted good and didn't include prawns which I'm allergic to. And he nailed it! He suggested I get the crispy beef which was delicious.

The only downside to this restaurant is the price, which you would expect considering how nice the place looks and the variety of options they offer."
0,Nicole S.,Dancing Fish,"Dancing Fish is an Indonesian restaurant in Bangsar Shopping Centre (BSC). There are quite a few Indonesian restaurants around but to me Dancing Fish is the real deal. Its really authentic Indonesian food and they have a lot of the traditional type food. Cant remember the names of the dishes cause Indonesian dishes have really confusing names.

I would describe the food as quite similar to chinese/malay food. They have satay too but its a little different in taste. The service was really good, as i went with a friend that was a regular. She was greeted and asked how she was by the staff. I thought that was really nice cause the staff are attentive and remember their regular customers.

Pricing is expensive but i think its very well fitted to the quality of the food and definitely the ambiance. I really liked the layout of the restaurant and the seats were comfy while the deco cozy. Will definitely go back soon, and if ever i crave Indonesian food i'd opt for Dancing Fish compared Bumbu Desa etc."
0,Biresh V.,Dancing Fish,"Had a company lunch here just now and we chose the Set Menu D which came with two types of rice - yellow and white, deep fried fish, fried tofu, prawns in sambal sauce, satay, grilled eggplant covered in sambal, lamb shank, paku pakis is turmeric gravy and dessert in the form of lemongrass jelly. Final verdict, it was delicious! Oh yeah drink the Kedondong ice drink. Adds a punch!"
0,Rebecca W.,Dancing Fish,"Located among the fine-dining restaurants in Bangsar Shopping Centre, there lies a contemporary Malay-Indon restaurant - Dancing Fish. The name sounded very playful but they are committed to bring authentic Indonesian cuisine to their patrons.

While waiting for our main dishes to be ready, we were served with Emping with Sambal Terasi - grounded Melinjo seed mixed with flour and deep fried till crispy. It has a nutty and bitter aftertaste but goes very well with the spicy sambal. It was definitely an addictive appetizer. The other favourte was their Tofu Tower - soft silky tofu with flavourful gravy. Finally, the highlight of the night - The Dancing Fish! Withouft a doubt, it was one of the most beautiful plated dish I've seen - Nila fish butterflied and deep fried till crispy. After taking one look at the fish, I understood why it was name ""Dancing Fish"". The fish was plated as if it waas still alive and dancing on the plate. The fish was super crispy and delicious by itself, however, you can dip it into the Sambal Terasi with Kicap to add some heat to it. I was amaze at how almost oil-free the fish was, and don't worry about the bones - you can safely consume them along with the meat.

A meal in Dancing Fish would not come cheap, but you can taste the passion and details the chef has put into each and every dish they serve."

We went to Dancing Fish for dinner quite often as my mum loves the food there. Finding parking there was really easy and convenient too!

I personally didn't like the famous dish which the restaurant is named after - the Dancing Fish, because I find it too dry. I prefer the Ikan Bakar. It was really fresh and the meat was tender. The other dish that we usually order was Beef Rendang. It tastes nice however the portion was really small.  

Their drink, if you order Barley or Lime Barley, is refillable. The service there was pretty good. The staff were attentive and they often came to refill our drinks before we had to ask for it. It is a restaurant that I would recommend if you are craving for some Indonesian food."
0,Jin Wen L.,Dancing Fish,"Food: 3/5

Dancing Fish was the only Indonesian Restaurant that I went to in Malaysia. I've always been a fan of Tahu Telur since my first encounter with Indonesian food in London. So, the first thing I looked for in Dancing Fish was Tahu Telur. It was my favourite dish when I first dine in an Indonesian restaurant in London. Interestingly, they also offered two types of rice - white rice or yellow rice. Both goes really well with the dishes.

The service there was amazing too! The barley drinks are refillable and so is the rice. The waiters always keep a look out and circulate among the tables to make sure all customers have enough rice and drinks. The other dish that I really liked was their Beef Rendang. However, the portion was really small, barely enough for 2 to 3 people.

The signature dish - Dancing Fish, comes with different types of sauce. I've only tried the original one but I didn't really like it as it was a little too dry. The presentation was really nice though. I recalled being quite impressed when I first saw the dish being served."
0,Janey W.,Dancing Fish,"The Indonesian food here is like nothing I've ever eaten. Everything was tasty and there were surprising textures at every turn. My favorite plate was the signature 'dancing fish' which was artfully presented and perfectly crispy. Most of the other dishes we ordered were served with crunchy emping chips which are pretty addicting. Actual food aside, I'd say that the true highlight of our experience was the impeccable service by every staff member who serviced us. They were very accommodating to our party and a spectacled gentleman even took the time to educate us about his native cuisine and answer our questions. Add to that the classy ambiance, and I'd say this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in K.L.!"
0,Stephanie X.,Dancing Fish,"To what I can recall, I've never been to any Indonesian restaurants here in Kuala Lumpur. The closest encounter would be here at Dancing Fish Bangsar Shopping Centre. Not purely Indonesian but close enough.
When one of my girlfriends told me she had made dinner reservations at Dancing fish, I was pretty tickled by it, not something you'd hear every day. Here they serve a fusion of malay & Indonesian delicacies. So if you are a big fan of belacan (prawn paste), you would definitely want to try this place out. For appetizers, they serve you Emping with sambal terasi. Emping I would say is similar to the 'papadom' you would get at an Indian restaurant which is typically made out of nuts from what I gathered. It's just something for you to munch on & mind you it is addictive.
As for the veggies, we ordered the Gulai Pucuk Paku (which is greens smothered with rich coconut gravy) & the terung sambal, I loved the sourish ending to each bite! We ordered the chef's recommended 'Dancing Fish' which was typically deep fried fish served on top of a sweet & sour salad mix as well as sambal & kicap for the sauce. Nothing great but appetizing enough! Lastly, for the poultry we had the charcoal grilled spring chicken which was quite flavorful. The tasty gravies & sauces together with the steaming hot white rice, is simply unexplainable.
The restaurant can be quite noisy from the groups of people that flock this place, heck I could be one of them! A good crowd at the end of the day could only mean one thing, cheap or good food, I would go with the latter on this one."
0,Jyn-Mun N.,Dancing Fish,"Delicious, affordable and fast! I really liked the fried fish and crispy beef with rice as they have a unique flavour.The appetisers they serve are crackers that look like prawn crackers, but don't be fooled by their looks as they taste very bitter."
0,Derick W.,Ah Cheng Laksa,"For a quick meal, this is a place to head to. They serve nice asam laksa, curry laksa & nasi lemak rendang. Set lunch is confined to noodles only & comes with a free drink. Portions are a bit small for heavy eaters. So, snack is an option if it is not filling."
0,Eveline L.,Thai Garden Village,"Thai Garden Village is a pretty restaurant located along Jalan Kepong. It  is not visible from the main road but it is easy to find. Just turn into a road beside Shell petrol station and it will be on your left. They have a parking space in front of the restaurant so parking is hassle free! This is not really a authentic Thai restaurant but I think is more of a fusion style Thai as they have some not so Thai dishes. I believe they are famous for BBQ and grilled dishes.

You can choose to seat indoor or the very pretty outdoor area. Dishes that I recommend includes Grilled Saba Fish with Thai Wasabi sauce, Tom Yam Seafood, pineapple fried rice and also Steamed Fish in Spicy Lime Sauce. For drinks, definitely get the buarlonglong juice (not sure if I spelled that right though). It is a very refreshing juice. Their Red Ruby dessert is also quite nice and not too  sweet.

Overall, choices is plenty on the menu and price is reasonable. And for those with kids, they have a playground area to keep the kids busy. However, do try not to come too late as they can get a little busy during dinner time."
0,Sabina W.,Kedai Kopi dan Makanan Hong Lai 蓬莱茶餐室,"The food here is amazing!!

There is something, the name is directly translated to Moonlight Noodles (view the picture with the raw egg), which is amazingly tasty!! A must try!!

The fried mee hun is good too. They also offer a chili yee mee, which gets tastier with each bite. Unless you love it really spicy, I suggest you tell them to limit how much chili they use because it is potentially overwhelming as they use chili padi for this.

I also understand that they offer their own soya bean drink but I only tried their chinese tea, which was alright.

The place is a little dirty, this is a typical chinese restaurant setup. The food takes forever to get to the table but it is completely worth it!"
0,Alise G.,Dolly Dim Sum,"This is one of the cutest restaurants I have dined in this year. I felt like I entered into Porcelain Doll World. Dolly Dim Sum aims to create a modern interpretation of a traditional Chinese teahouse. The interior design of this restaurant is breathtaking, I loved the place so much I had to follow them on Instagram to relive the experience. I visited Malaysia for about nine days and ate here about three times. Now anyone who has ever visited Malaysia the restaurant selection is vast, so this place was that amazing I had to come back a few times.

I ended ordering the watermelon lychee, chicken wings, roasted BBQ bun, and Szechuan dumplings. The food came out pretty fast, it was light and fresh. The wings were not what I am use to in the USA, they were boiled and a bit broken up. I loved the BBQ bun and the Szechuan dumplings. I ended up ordering another round. The staff is really friendly even the to-go packing is beautiful.

Dolly Dim Sum accepts American Express as most places do in Malaysia. The food was really good and inexpensive. I really enjoyed my experience here."
0,Nathalie S.,Dolly Dim Sum,"Best Dim Sum I've ever had! The service is great and everything tasted fantastic. I can highly recommend the crispy shrimp cheong fun.
It was just a bit confunsing that they had sweet things in the normal menu and not in the dessert part of the card, but nevermind it was still delicious.
It was so good we had to go two times in a row to taste all the great different varieties they have."
0,Azraai A.,Dolly Dim Sum,"In this review, I'm going to basically rave about two things, how delicious their food is and what a wonderful job the interior designer did. So if you're not interested in reading further, you have basically already gotten the gist of it.

My friend was having his off-day and he had always wanted to give this place a try. He had heard rave reviews from his other friends and being a foodie himself, didn't want to feel left out. Because I mainly work from home and my working hours are very flexible, I was his only other confidant in his mid-week food hunting adventures. Food. I was all right with it.

I mean, its food right? I'm always ok with food, I want to get married to food. Ok.

But when a place has a fantastic combination of good food and fantastic furniture, I am more than just ok with it. I would get married to food in this restaurant. It had an open concept and the space is very well lit. This was mainly due to the application of glass walls and also a glass pergola concept in its ceiling treatment. The birdcages that hung from said ceiling was a rather nice artistic touch making the room look and feel like a modern terrace.

Now lets go on to the food. The menu had an impressive amount of Dim Sum on it and the prices are a little on the high side. We ordered a few types of Dim Sum, making them each as different from one another as we can so we could taste the extent of their dishes and not taste the same thing twice. This way we get a whole range of flavors without putting out too much money. The food was absolutely amazing. Just writing this review now makes me long for its flavors and it made my ears tingle a little.

I implore you guys to go try this place out. Seriously, if you don't want to marry food after that then I strongly suggest you go see a therapist."
0,Sara M.,Dolly Dim Sum,"Panfried Salted Fish Bun tastes as good as it looks. Filled with lightly baked salted fish, fragrant ginger! Great bakery! and really nice different food! I wouldn't advice you to have this more than once a week though. I thought the taste was too strong so I surely want to give it sometime before I go back there.

The staff member was nice and helpful! spoke little English so it wasn't hard to figure out from him what was in every different option. definitely recommend this if you haven't tried it yet! just know that you will either love it or hate it :D"
0,Nadia S.,Dolly Dim Sum,"Love this place! Not only is it beautiful to look at with its huge windows and funky light fixtures (seriously, wish I had some photos for you) the dim sum here is also delicious! The Siu Mai... just try it, guys. Aside from that, the prawn chee cheong fun and fried rice are good too. For the kids, the chicken congee is great.

Prices are affordable and staff is accommodating. We were there with a huge party of 20 people and the manager actually took charge of making sure we got the food as ordered. Appreciated the leadership. Huge plus point - they have their own toilet, somewhat a rarity for restaurants situated in shopping malls.

I recommend this place. For both the food and the photo op opportunities."
0,Lucie B.,Dolly Dim Sum,"The decor and everything here is nice. We went here for dim sum since it is pork free. I found most of the dim sum varieties to taste the same and they just weren't very flavorful. It's just an okay place, prices are on par with the area. Nothing to rave about."
0,Sammy P.,Dolly Dim Sum,"Cheong Fun, Congee, Egg Tart, Chicken Wings, Har Gow are all very good for the location.  The setting is fairly spacious.  I'm used to crowded dim sum restaurants with very little elbow room.  It's not Ipoh quality but recommended for KL city center.  I would not park at Avenue K however as parking is tight.  Try the lot directly across Dolly Dim Sum on the side street for 5 RM on a weekend morning.  Avenue K will charge the same."
0,Kris A.,Lim Kee Cafe,"Really elegant cafe with light greenish color contrasting with dark wooden decor. You couldn't miss it if you are walking along Jalan Sultan. It has white wooden blinds with an clear and 60s logo that spells Lim Kee.

The cafe is spacious, clean and cool and the coffee is aromatic and close to bold. I would love them to have soy latte but they don't serve that.

The service staff and barista is very friendly and the ambiance's just great for those of us looking for a place to read and chill. So glad that it's not a chatty and noise place.

I'll come here again for sure."
0,Dominique G.,Lim Kee Cafe,"I found this café because it was suggested on Condé Nast traveler. It's really cute and has a calm, yet trendy vibe. I ordered a matcha latte and Roti Kahwin (a toast with butter and delicious coconut jam). They also have a selection of tasty-looking cake slices behind the counter. There are a few people chatting and a few on their laptops, not too busy (but it's also Monday). I would come back here and also recommend to other visiting Kuala Lumpur."
0,Maggie T.,Mario & Luigi,"In love with their food! It's not the usual fancy fine dining place to expect but it's a pretty decent environment for one! :) Loved the fact that almost everything on their menu tasted awesome!

They have a really comfy spot upstairs, which is also a bar and it has both smoking and non-smoking areas. The dining area is also very unique, as you can see through the kitchen and watch the chef work their magic to turn food to amazing dishes!

I left the place with a huge satisfaction as I couldn't stop remembering about the good taste of their cured salmon trout, tuna tartare and their tagliatelle. These were amaze balls!

I highly recommend this place if you want a switch of food environment and food choices. It's really unique and it's placed in a less obvious part of the hectic city.

I don't usually give 5 star reviews, but when I do, you know what i meant :)"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Mario & Luigi,"If you're looking for a place to dine that's exclusive and different from just another restaurant, you would want to pay Mario & Luigi a visit. As you'd know it's not easy to get a parking at this area, but fret' not as they do have their own valet here who could ease your worries.

The restaurant itself as you would know, similar to other restaurants under The Big Group, has a lot of attention paid to every small details of the interior and use of decorations. The first thing that got my attention was the tree that's standing at the al fresco dining area. With their rustic decorations and windy backyard, I would say that this could easily be a very romantic date spot. Of course, their wine list would help just notch the romance.

If you're familiar with this area, you would know Hit & Mrs, but something different about Mario & Luigi is that they do not change their menu like how they do it for Hit & Mrs. Instead, they do sometimes change what's being served in the same dish, e.g. they might serve a different seafood in the pasta, depending what's the freshest that they could get in the market. That being said, you know that you are getting the fresh foods while you're there.

I tried their truffle pasta and their sea urchin pasta. Definitely loved how the truffle pasta was so precisely flavored, that you would still taste the other ingredients in it, but you wouldn't get the frustration of not tasting the truffle. And, the sea urchin pasta was a very delicate dish too, cooked with crab bisque, topped with fresh sea urchin. The choices of primi are generally under a hundred Ringgit, which isn't entirely on the cheap side. But, I personally find it worth it, provided the ambience, food quality and the overall dining experience.

For desserts, we picked their panna cotta, and definitely loved this Italian cooked cream which was presented nothing less than what I would call an art. It's served with a big tear drop of sorbet, and I liked it for not being too sweet. With the crunch of some muesli in it, it was a good wrap for the dinner!"
0,John W.,Mario & Luigi,"- Location: close to Bangsar and far enough from the hustle and overhyped bustle of Bangsar.
- Parking : they have a valet! Just say you're eating at Mario. It's awesome. Definitely a win here. 5/5
- Set up : Dining set up - fancy. There is literally a tree in the restaurant. It's pretty fancy. Very good for dates.
- Upstairs - bar and lounge. Yeah,  a lounge. A whole lounge to sit down and relax with friends. Highly recommended for a fancy evening with friends.
- Service : 5 star service. Actually feels like being on a first class flight.
- Food : Get the truffle pasta. If you enjoy 'telur mata' (sunny side up egg) on your nasi lemak, this is a whole different level of pasta.
- Drinks: Get their signature cocktail.
- Highly recommended for dates or impressing your future in laws."
0,Tita T.,Mario & Luigi,"Another awesome restaurant from the Big group
For starters the zucchini fritters is delicious
For main, we tried linguine Bay bugs, I think this was the winner among the three that we tried. The truffle tagliatelle was delicious
However we would not suggest the risoni beef cheek.. The beef taste may be too strong and overwhelming for some."
0,Sabina W.,Mario & Luigi,"Mario & Luigi is located outside of my usual food-hunting zone, but I'm definitely returning to this place because it is A-MA-ZING!

The premise is split into two zones, the bar upstairs and the restaurant downstairs.

Decor and atmosphere: I would say that it is a mix of modern minimalist and quirky. From the iconic Sophia Loren and Jayne Mansfield potrait, the Mario Bros light display to the little things like selection of cutlery, I'd say it is evident that the people behind Mario & Luigi had a very deliberate process in designing the place. I also really like the semi-open kitchen that allowed us a little glimpse into what happens behind the scenes.

Food: I had the Bruschetta, Cured Salmon Trout, Burrata, Tuna Tartare, Capellini, Tagliatelle, Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Rack and the Tiramisu. I enjoyed all of it but what amazed me the most were the Lamb Rack, Tagliatelle, the Cured Salmon Trout and the Tiramisu. Words cannot explain how delicious the entire experience was!

Service: The waiters were very attentive and were constantly offering refills. They were also very polite and friendly!

Price: I reviewed their pricing and think that, for their high quality food and service, their prices are pretty reasonable, but not right for those with a tight budget. This is a place for a fine dining experience!

Parking: Might need to look around for a bit to find a spot"
0,Veronica C.,Mario & Luigi,"A comfortable, quiet and romantic restaurant that will surely impress your date. If you plan to organise a small party, Mario & Luigi will not let you down. You can expect courteous and attentive service. In addition, the food is cooked perfectly. It was my first visit. My Portuguese good friend, other fellow Yelp Elites and I were very impressed by the delicious and well-presented food. Head over to Mario & Luigi!"
0,Aja N.,Mario & Luigi,"Mmmmmmmm. Definitely no fault in the food, a bit pricey, lovely airy ambiance in the day and romantic city at night. Food has so far always been good, the service with slight hitches."
0,Loong F.,Mario & Luigi,"* Lunch time on weekends, you will get some pretty private moment until you notice the waiter will be observing your every move to anticipate your needs.
* Ambience: Just perfect with some small tree in the middle.
* Food: Presentation is not fancy but clean. Taste wise, naturally very delicious. The natural essence of the food is well preserved.
* Service: See my first point, is great and elegant but sometimes, less is more."
0,Eunice C.,Basil Pasta House,"Folks! If you are around the Kuchai Lama area, feel free to drop-by Basil to try out their oh-so-damn-good pastas! Well, it is pretty obvious right? The food coincides with the name of the restaurant. Since this restaurant was just opened, I believe they will do whatever it takes to ensure that their customers will receive the best treatment and service.

On a lighter note, the price of their food is affordable and their food portions are huge. Yes, HUGE! Well, not all menus are like that but most of them are as I have a few of my friends who agreed on the statement when I said ""1 person cannot finish that bowl of pasta"", especially the cheesy ones like carbonara pasta. I love the ambience of this restaurant especially when you come here to chill with your love ones after a long day's work.  The downside would be the parking as there are many other eateries around that area, so try your best to come at least half an hour early before the proposed time to meet with your friends and love ones. Other than that, *life two thumbs up*! Nothing beats good food, affordable in price, good ambience and good service. So yeah! Make a visit!"
0,Gie N.,Basil Pasta House,"Crunchy softshell crab spaghetti to be recommended
Service friendly, prices reasonable."
0,Jay O.,Basil Pasta House,"Would you like an eventful yet peaceful dinner?

Well, let me tell you something folks. Basil pasta house will certainly be your number one choice! Pasta, I believe is a very common mutual food that people love but to create a customary Italian pasta to be such toothsome, Basil pasta house is definitely  one of the very few rare ones!!! Basil pasta house is situated in Jalan Kuchai Lama in the land of food paradise, you could find amazing restaurants around.

Basil Pasta house displayed a simple yet comforting modernisation of interior design , it certainly matches the food that comes along. However, the restaurant are not spacious in my opinion. Basil Pasta house offers the wide array of Italian pasta. Thanks to my sister I was able to try and witness a true Italian pasta. It might come to as a shocker to you with their distinctive taste of a customary pasta could be. As starter, I would definitely said their service are brilliant! , fast & efficient not to mention extremely friendly. Hold your bubbles cause I am about to tell you , their pasta.

I love their Chinese egg yolk pasta (RM 18.90) , it has such golden combination and yet makes the noodle to be tender and soft along with fried squid- yummy. Next, we have their customary smoked duck breast ( RM 16.90 ) , totally a yummer! You can also go for their seafood tomato pasta (RM 19.90) and countless more.  Sounds promising isn't it? Wait, there's more. You can always go for their wild mushroom soup- creamy and delish! Super delicious. Plus, their signature basil soda , best thing ever and did I mention their price here are affordable? Pretty reasonable pricing with satisfying portion.

Overall, my experience are superb! I love every inch of their work and the place. Don't worry, you could reserve ahead! Come here if your in the area!!!!"
0,Beatrice B.,Basil Pasta House,"I've been wanting to visit this place since I heard of it, and its doesn't disappoint! There's a huge variety of pasta to choose from. Everything from spaghetti to gnocchi! I'm very satisfied. It's a little busy during lunch time and wait time is a little long, but it's ultimately worth it. I tried their Aglio Olio, and it's amazing. My brother is in love with his Gnocchi, and my friends are super satisfied with their own pastas. We're super happy. Great job!"
0,Chai Y.,Basil Pasta House,"I can't decide what to eat as there are too many choices in the menu. I ended up with pesto pasta as what recommended by the waiter. The price is reasonable with the portion served, the taste is so great and it's a refreshing one. My Fren and I had a very satisfying meal for dinner. Definitely looking forward to trying all the pasta and risotto in the menu!"
0,Chieh M.,Basil Pasta House,"I've tried many pastas they serve, and their all really good!! They have a huge choice of pastas and appetisers, the appetisers are really good too! The price is really reasonable as well. Give it a try if you're around kuchai lama!"
0,Mimi H.,Sany Char Kuey Teow,"One of the greatest Char kuey Teow in the city. Woohoooo!
This restaurant located behind Istana Budaya and near with Titiwangsa lake.If you come during night. You will notice this stall easliy since it will be crowded at night.
This restaurant only open at 4pm until 4am. So dont misunderstood about this restaurant has closed when you comes at noon.

Ok nowwwwwww. i will tell you more about their char kuey teow. In a small plate, the kuey teow is wet,flavour - not too spicy ,a little bit sweet,the chef might be use tomato sauce,it is really suit with the taste also what made Sany char kuey teow different with typical char kuey teow is- They have their own soy sauce. Which also available to buy at this restaurant. 2-3 middle size prawn will made prawn lover loves this menu! There are 2 type Char kuey teow- Normal (RM 4.50) , Special (RM5.50). For special kuey teow there will be egg add on the top.

Frankly speaking, one plate of char kuey teow isn't enough - it is reall in small portion. I need two plates at least to fulfill my craving. hihi

For other menu, other goreng-goreng menu also available,satay,sata and otak-otak. But i never tried their satay. Since i came here for char kuey teow only . Don't miss out to check this penang-style fried char kuey teow !"
0,Alfie C.,Sany Char Kuey Teow,"Famously know of it's signature Char Kuey Teow but that doesn't mean that you should underestimate the other foods that available here.

The Chicken Kerabu is nice. Sweet and sour but also spicy.  This food here are mainly affordable but the environment is probably the only matter. The place is kinda dark and there are lots of mosquito. You might wanna bring your own spray."
0,Xue L.,Madam Kwan's,"Decent malay food and good quality ingredients. My personal fave is the nasi lemak with curry chicken. The curry was so tender and flavorful and the rice was so fragrant. The malay satay chicken were also very tender and the peanut sauce was delicious. Other dishes were ok.

The service is quick and the staff are nice. It's located inside the pavilion mall so cleanliness definitely isn't a problem."
0,Ken B.,Madam Kwan's,"Was in the pavilion shopping centre today and my wife suggested madam kwans restaurant, I had nasi lemak with chicken rendang, looked great but i was very disapointed when started to eat, it was not at all spicy and was very sweet with no crunch the traditional peanuts were missing from my plate, i feel they have deviated away from local flavours and catering for tourists also going easy on the chili, for me a good tasty nasi lemak is spicy and a little sweet.
My wifes Sambal Petai was also very sweet.
Prices were high, but that is expected from a restaurant in Pavilion.
The restaurant was very clean and the service was great."
0,Noor Khan I.,Madam Kwan's,"Was here on a weekday around 11am. Only 3 of 2 pax each tables occupied. Staff seems more concerned on delivery orders and took a long time to prepare a simple fried rice dish.

Will seriously rethink ever coming here again"
0,Kenneth W.,Madam Kwan's,"If you are in Kuala Lumpur for the first time and are not familiar with Malaysian food, then Madam Kwan's is a pretty safe place to start acquinting yourself with this flavourful cuisine.

Located in many of the established malls, MK is a popular spot for both locals and tourists. By 6pm one will see lineups start to build up.

I couldn't make up my mind on the wide variety and settled on the nasi bojari, tri colour rice with deep fried chicken leg, beef rendang, and Assam prawns. All three items were freshly cooked and came piping hot.  

The taste is really fantastic. I was full after working on it for 20 minutes. But I did leave room for my favourite dessert the cendol.

Highly recommend this place."
0,Meng L.,Madam Kwan's,"Over rated. The fish head curry was very disappointing . The Curry was watery, lacking in salt and generally tasteless. The fish head was generous and tender. Best dish was the morning glory stir fried with Belachan. I guess you can't go too wrong with that. The stir fried beef with ginger and shallots was ok, as the beef was tough. My view - disappointing."
0,Jon C.,Madam Kwan's,"A very large and spacious restaurant that is comfortable, clean, good for large groups with food that is well presented and tastes good.

Tried a bunch of food and all was very good. In particular there was this one rice dish with fried chicken that tasted delicious.

The staff, when you could get their attention was friendly and never rude, but I always felt there was a lot of staff standing around that you couldn't get their attention. We always had dishes that needed to be cleared.

I'd say it's easy to come here cause it gives what many restaurants cannot, the sense of cleanliness and space while offering the same food at similar to same quality if not better. But I think their service could improve a bit."
0,Berdie L.,Madam Kwan's,Food was ok but service is lacking. We had to follow up on one of our dishes many times before they finally brought it out.
0,Vinay P.,Madam Kwan's,"First Nasi Lemak experience went well. The chicken curry is one of the best I've had in Southeast Asia. The overall experience, including price, service, and accoutrements (rice, anchovies, and pickled vegetables) were average. Overall, I would definitely come back for another hit of that chicken curry."
0,Suria N.,Madam Kwan's,"Can't leave Kuala Lumpur before having a nasi lemak from Madam Kwan's. We had lunch here and enjoyed the nasi lemak with chicken curry, and nasi bojari with fried chicken. We also had iced tea and lychee drink to wash our meals down. Good service and nice ambiance. Cost us MYR66.60 or about SGD22.20 for everything. Not bad!"
0,Syamin I.,Madam Kwan's,"Well the name of the restaurant is MADAM KWAN'S. guess first, is this the chinese restaurant or malay restaurant?. you're good the name looks like chinese but they served malaysian cuisine like rojak,  nasi lemak, fried rice, and lots more. Madam Kwan's is a family restaurant. i came here with my family members to celebrate my mom's birthday.

They have quite big  space and it's comfortable to spent time with the family. The workers also friendly and dressed up well. I loved those foods, all of it soo yummey. For me, the price of the foods is reasonable and still under budget. im pretty sure it's HALAL. no doubts about it.

The portion of the meals will satisfied you. For my small tummy, i've to share with my sister. Madam Kwan's gives a satisfying dining experience to all of you."
0,Nicole S.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"Lemon Garden is a buffet style restaurant located in the prestigious Shangri-La hotel on Jalan Sultan Ismail. I visited Lemon Garden for the very impressive Ramadhan Buffet because this is the best time to visit all the buffets! Its rm180 per person which i think is expensive. The spread was obviously very good and there was a selection of practically everything you could ever want. There was japanese, italian, malaysian, middle eastern etc. dont even get me started on the dessert spread (thats where i was most of the time).

Personally, everything was good, food was yummy and seafood fresh. There were many people there that night but it wasn't over crowded because the spread was set up really well so you never had to line up for anything. I would definitely go back to enjoy this yummy spread again soon."
0,David L.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"One of the better Shangri-La hotel buffets. The breakfast and lunch are quite spectacular even for Shangri-La standards. Very nice interior, airy, modern and bright. Food is fresh and high quality with also good service."
0,Veronica C.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"The restaurant is located in beautiful garden with a big koi pond. The food taste so much better because it was a lunch treat by my boss. (^_^)v
There were dishes of sashimi, cheese, oysters and need. The salmon sashimi was a big hit. Really enjoyed myself."
0,Theresa H.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"*lovely international buffet.
*So relaxing sitting in the garden next to koi pond in the morning.
*Would come to this buffet even if I were not staying at the Shangri-La. *Local cuisine as well as international offerings.
*best coffee
*Terrific service as always."
0,Shuen P.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"Last Chinese New Year, I went to Shangri-La lemon Garden Cafe for their buffet dinner with my other half and his family. They choose to come here during a Friday night because this place serve a wide variety of seafood (only during weekend) which includes King crab, fresh oysters, crayfish, scallops and of course the usual crabs, prawns and fish.

The other reason they choose to come here was because this is by far the best buffet place they have been (it was my first time though) because this place serve a huge variety of Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and the local Malaysian cuisines. I'm not much of a buffet person because I can't eat a lot at one time. I'm those kinda person who take a lot of small meals a day (munch whole day). So bringing me to a buffet is sort of a waste of money.

However, to make my meal worth it, I ate as much expensive dishes as I can. Had the King crabs, scallops, lots of fishes and of course our simple Malaysian cuisine such as satay and roti canai and finally the desserts! The part I'm looking forward to from the moment I stepped into the restaurant. Tried almost every one of the desserts there except for the ice cream (not an ice cream person). Cakes, puddings, and more cakes! Yumsssss..

After our scrumptious meal, we had a cuppa coffee or tea to wrap up the night. Can't really compare their buffet with other restaurants because I hardly go for buffets. But I must say, they have so much to choose from! That's why we came back again few weeks later. Yes, just after few weeks...

Couldn't remember the exact price but if I'm not wrong, it's around RM160 ++ per pax and the hotel parking is around RM20 (depending on how long you're there for).

P/S : if you're planning to go for the seafood feast, do make booking earlier to avoid disappointment !"
0,Rebecca W.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"I've been to The Lemon Garden Café in Shangri-La Hotel many times, and it never once let me down. Seriously, I like the buffet spread a lot - quality and variety.

There were crab legs when I last visited, and they were so fresh and sweet! Although it would require a bit of work to de-shell the legs, but it was worth at the end. If you are into raw food like me, look out for their scallops and if you are lucky, you might spot the ones with roe. The scallops were fresh and sweet too. No complains here.

I tried some of their Chinese spread but it was average. I thought the steamed fish was better than the dim sum. They have quite a fair bit of quality control in their food, and you can taste it in the raw spread such as the sashimi and sushi. However, the cold soba I took was only average. I didn't quite like the texture of the noodles.

On the other hand, the spread for the Indian cuisine were really good. The mutton curry I took was delicious - the meat was tender in aromatic curry sauce.

Lemon Garden Café does have great varieties of quality spread, but the pricing is high. Having said so, if you have that extra budget to splurge I would totally recommend this place."
0,Jason Y.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"Going there for Chinese New Year lunch, there was a promotion buffet for Chinese New Year. They have a huge variety of food ranging from Malay food such as Nasi lemak and satay, Japanese food like sushi, Chinese food like pau and siu mai, and a huge dessert bar with cakes, ice cream, chocolate fountain, and fruits. However, despite the choices and the 5 star hotel it's located at, the food certainly doesn't taste like it should. Adult was Rm90++ and children was Rm45++ so it certainly doesn't justify the price paid for the quality they had. American Express platinum card entitles you to a discount of 50% for 2 person, 33% for 3 person and 20% for 4 person and above."
0,Jyn-Mun N.,Lemon Garden Cafe,"I went to Lemon Garden for the Christmas Eve buffet at night and they served a variety of food from Japanese noodles to delicious fois gras. They also served scrumptious desserts like ice-cream, log cakes, breadsticks dipped in chocolate and so on. The price was expensive, but for the food we were eating, it was worth it as fois gras, blackberries, japanese crab and caviar are quite expensive. The staff were singing christmas carols to lighten our moods on Christmas Eve too!"
0,Shika M.,KyoChon 1991,Absolutely love! The spicy chicken is very delicious. Although it's a bit pricey I would still eat it anyway.
0,Immaculate I.,KyoChon 1991,"A local Malaysian friend recommended this place. It was empty on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was attentive and welcoming. I ordered the red (spicy) wings with garlic fried rice and a Coca-Cola. Priced around 25 ringgit

You get a wet napkin and a glove (I guess people eat their chicken wings with gloves on). The kimchi that's served is bursting with flavors. The vegetables are crunchy and delicious.

It took about 10 minutes before my wings arrived. They were crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful throughout. I definitely recommend a visit. I've heard great reviews about their fried rice with egg so another visit is to be expected.

The missing star was because my rice never arrived even after requesting the second time and getting charged for it until I disputed the charge."
0,Amelie S.,Ah Loong Grilled Seafood,"One of the favourites in KL, fresh seafood, love the crabs! Recommended to those who'd like to enjoy the local atmosphere and cuisine."
0,James L.,El Cerdo,"A lavish restaurant that is great for birthdays. They will put up a show for you and your friends if you order their suckling pig. You get to listen to their Spanish tradition on how they prepare and cut the pig with the plate and you break them later on for luck.

The interior decoration is filled with oink oink accents. Every wall is bound to have some pig ornaments, decorations, pictures on them. It makes the whole place a delight to just browse around.

I've been here a few times and almost tried out the entire menu and I've not find anything dissatisfying. That do mean a lot about a restaurant. So if you're thinking of a place for your birthday, try this!"
0,Jyn-Yann N.,El Cerdo,"Do you like breaking things? Well, in El Cerdo, you get to break a plate if you order their ever so famous suckling pig.  

Every weekend (either that or it's every sunday) for lunch, they have this special buffet table for lunch. You have to pay extra for it though.

 Their paella is also quite good although I would prefer it if they had foie gras in it. We went there twice. During the first visit there, we asked the chef to customise a paella for us. We asked him to add foie gras in the paella since it wasn't on the menu. He did as we requested and it was perfect. The second time round, we ordered for the same foie gras with paella. Unfortunately, they said that they don't serve that.  

 That was the only disappointment. Other than that, the food was great! Everything, even the ambience of the place was really nice. I enjoyed myself but wouldn't give it a 5 star because they don't serve foie gras paella (yes, I'm that big a fan of foie gras)."
0,Kimberly X.,El Cerdo,"Fan of all things pork?Let me tell you, this place serves a lot more than your regular old pork chop or bacon strips. Located on the bar lined streets of Changkat, El Cerdo is a popular place to head to before some bar hopping.

El Cerdo proudly displays their 'nose to tail' porcine experience by utilising every part of it. Their call to fame here is their suckling pig which goes for almost RM200 for a half pig. The most fun aspect to this dining experience is that you're given a plate to break and throw into a bucket as it is based on the Spanish tradition of throwing away the bad luck. Definitely not a place for the price conscious, however it is an experience by itself, what with all that plate breaking going on almost constantly in the background."
0,Jyn-Mun N.,El Cerdo,"El Cerdo is one of the best Spanish restaurants I have ever been to! Unfortunately, it is non-halal as it is famous for its suckling pig. If you order a suckling pig, you will get the chance to break a plate, which is El Cerdo tradition.

 The appetiser for El Cerdo is bread with dips, which I could pig out on as it is that good! Since I am a fois gras lover, we asked the chef to customise a paella for us and add fois gras in it. It tasted lovely and didn't cost us too much! The staff are very polite and friendly as they come by the customer's tables to ask how the food was and to make small talk. The food comes at a good pace, so you don't have to wait too long!"
0,Sara M.,In Colonial,"The best coffee you'll ever have in KL! I am saying kL, because once you go to Indonesia you will get that poopy awesome coffee everyone talks about :D not sure if I can ever get myself to try it but well! These guys have an amazing coffee and I believe they even won awards for that! I had that coffee this morning and it was tasty and just amazing!

You can also get lunch here, the restaurant is just beautiful and the setting is amazing! this place is actually super perfect for a date night! The meals are at around 38rm and above! you get these deals for two people or more so it's really amazing even for family gatherings."
0,Babs A.,In Colonial,Love the energy here! The staff were exceptionally warm and welcoming. Loved the special sea food fried rice. I would definitely love to come back
0,Marija S.,In Colonial,"In lithuania colonial style is very common and when I saw this restaurant I just knew i  have to stop by! :)

Yes the whole interior seems very fancy and glamorous and I was just so excited to open the menu and see what they offer!

I was super surprised to see that  the kitchen was Malaysian-Chinese, it was the last thing I expected! I was assured it is going to be western food ! Sometimes look can be tricky.:)

Nevertheless, the surprise was very pleasant, because their grilled squid soaked in savoury satay sauce was just glorious!

I couldnt believe it was only 22RM!

Definitely check it out!:)"
0,Penny W.,Pudu Hakka Noodles,"My dad brought me to this Hakka noodles stall when I started going tuition at Martin and it became my favourite Hakka noodles stall until today. It is located in front of the main road and it is very difficult to find parking especially during lunch hour. There was a few times I went there wanting to eat but gave up after going a few rounds around the area just because I can't find a parking spot.

They make the noodles themselves and it is certainly only one of a kind. I usually order the basic one without black sauce. It might look bland but when you eat it, it is really tasty and satisfying. The bowl of noodles is accompanied by a generous amount of minced pork and a few slices of char siew. I think what makes it taste really good is the pork lard. There is also another smaller bowl that has soup and wan tan. The wan tan is also one of the best because it holds together very well."
0,Elaine T.,Cielo,"Came here for the view!!
JK. (But really, yes lol. And the ambiance).

The steaks and seafood here are fantastic and extremely flavorful!! You can tell that everything is cooked well and a lot of effort was put into each dish. The service is top notch and they'll definitely take care of you to a point where you'll feel pampered. I really appreciate the welcome shot upon arrival.

They are pretty strict on arrival and seating time. They'll hold your table for only 15 minutes before giving it away to other people, although in most cases, a reservation should be made beforehand. Your dinner can also be only 1 hour and 30 minutes for the turn over time. They also do not allow flip flops or slippers. There were two ladies who tried to enter and they were turned away because they're wearing the wrong shoes. They should've known because confirmation emails and text messages were sent out.

Overall: one of my favorite meals in Asia! :)"
0,Wai Min K.,Restoran Sang Kee,"Although this restaurant is open for dinner, my family and I have never been here for dinner - we always come here for breakfast.

What I really like here is this dish that I order - it is curry mee mixed with plain soup (""ying yong"") with yee wat (fish paste). Yums! I always go for mixed soup, instead of just plain soup or curry. This stall is located near the fridge in the shop - the aunty there is very friendly and they are generous with their ingredients.

What's also popular here is the pork noodles. However (this is quite personal), I don't like ordering this because I find the aunty (possibly owner) very rude to her staff.

Anyway, there are a few other food options besides the above, like chee cheong fun, pan mee, chicken rice, etc - all of which are mostly decent.

PS: This place can be quite crowded on weekends."
0,Priyan P.,A Li Ya,"Even better than so much of the Sri Lankan food I've had in Sri Lanka!

Stopped in for lunch and had a feast:

String hoppers with all the fixins:  potato yellow curry in gravy, coconut sambol, fiery katta sambol, and sweet/savory Seeni sambol.

My fav was the amazing bone-in mutton curry. Also ordered with milk rice, and pittu.

I've never seen a single restaurant serve all these dishes in one place let alone do them all really well.

I went for lunch but apparently the star of the restaurant is the Crab curry. You bet I'll be back for that."
0,Veronica E.,A Li Ya,"Had four or five dishes and two were fabulous - string hopper kotha and the milk hoppers, pal appam, but the rest were so so at best.  The much vaunted crab curry was not good.  I make better crab curry at home and it paled in comparison to what my relatives make.  My favorite vegetable, drumstick, was poorly cooked.  I tried it first with a sothi and didn't like it.  When I told them that it wasn't good they suggest I order the curried version.  So I ordered that and it still wasn't good.  Anyway, for a pretty pricey place I would expect top notch food and I didn't get that."
0,Kar Yan G.,Nando's,"Nandooosssss. Who doesn't love Nandos?! Nando lovers will want to know which particular Nando restaurant in Klang Valley and Kuala Lumpur serves the best chicken, sides and other course! Well at least for now I can tell you which one is the best among 6 places that I have dined.

Well I would give the most credits to Nandos located in Mid Valley!! Believe it or not, they serves the most generous amount of chicken and sides! I find their chickens are much more tastier! I would definitely go Mid Valley just dine in Nandos. The next best will be Nandos in Subang Parade. Honestly they provide good services. Thumbs up for their efficient service for Nandos in IOI Mall. As for Nandos in Sunway Pyramid and Main place, I find it just average. After countless times of visiting it, Nandos in One Utama provided the worst service  as well as smaller servings of chicken and sides. I thought it would be bad if I only tried once and conclude it. But I actually visit it for 3 times and their services and servings were all terrible."
0,David S.,Nando's,"Great service, good pricing, the menu is a little scattered to read? That's the only thing."
0,Azraai A.,Nando's,"My brothers ex-girlfriend had a thing for Nando's, every time we went out together her first choice of restaurant would be Nando's. I now understand the breakup. Her frigid ways. In a relationship that is always growing and flourishing, one has to be able to be accepting and be more open to the many differences between both individuals. But enough about dating and relationships (blergh!) Lets talk about something more practical, like chicken.

Chicken will never let you down. Its hot, tender meat will always be there for you whenever you're feeling lost and alone. They come in a variety of flavors to ensure that your relationship stays interesting and non-complacent. Chicken understands. #relationshipgoals

The good people at Nando's have developed an art to grilling chicken. I like the branch in Mid Valley as compared to the one in Bangsar Village because I think it's less hectic and quieter. This way you get to savor the taste in peace, although that's not usually the case. As soon as the plate of chicken drops in front of me I turn into a complete barbarian. Eating with both hands, sauce on my cheeks, occasionally taking a swig of my iced lemon tea. It's not a pretty sight. In other occasions, I'm usually quite demure in my ways.

Don't forget their Peri-Peri sauce. Omg so delicious! And did you know that you could buy the Peri-Peri sauces by the bottles? That piece of information totally blew my mind when I first found out. Peri-Peri means birds eye chili and is also packed with Vitamins A and C. #truefact"
0,Alexandra M.,Nando's,"This is a really nice restaurant and it's so nice to my boyfriend always loves to go here.

We love their chicken and they're hot sauces that we even buy them for the house. The staff it's really nice and they're always so cute yelling something when you entered the place (which I'm just assuming that it makes the customers feel more invited and slightly amused). It's a really nice place and we do go to it a lot of the times because of their meal options.

You are able to share a plate between two people and it's less than RM65 or you can also choose to have separate meals, which are between RM12 to RM15. Its a very popular restaurant amongst my friends so do check it out.

Bon Appétit"
0,Aisyah S.,Nando's,"Now, I would like to tell you about the famous and well-known eatery here in Malaysia but the MidValley branch is where I am going to tell you my experience. Just like any other Nandos, the food is good. And the amount of time that it took for the food to arrive at my table was acceptable as I understand there were a lot of people around.
What I like about this Nandos is the service. As you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by almost all the workers in a vibrant and enthusiastic way. In my opinion, I find this very welcoming. And as an F&B business, this aspect is very important.
Even with the busy atmosphere of the restaurant, I am impressed of how the workers carried themselves. They had teamwork, diligence and were attentative to all the customer's needs. If you're looking for a nice place to eat in MidValley, go for Nandos, I would recommend it. But, you'd have to be okay with a slightly noisy atmosphere."
0,Alexandra M.,Mochi Sweets,"Japanese luxury sweets. Yes, there is such thing.

From green tea to chocolate mousse, honey lemon, blueberry cream and more. The average cost is somewhere around RM4 and that is quite luxurious in my opinion for these little bites.

The taste is absolutely delicious, the cream is soft and the ingredients fresh but the wait can be quite long. My favourites were the chestnut, blueberry, strawberry and honey lemon creams so if you want to try some traditional Japanese sweets do go ahead and try this."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Mochi Sweets,"Yep, pretty exciting, mochi goodness is at 30% off now!

I was so excited last night when i see the 30% off sign that they have sticked on their counter.

Having always liked their mochis, even though the expensive price, you can actually see that they are really delicate in keeping the mochi fresh and at its good condition. Even when they sell it to you,they will advise on how long you should take it out from the fridge before you eat it. So, this is quality difference that we are talking about.

One of my favourites so far is their tiramisu flavor. So, i kind of stocked up since they are doing promotions!

However,  tips - don't buy too much and think of keeping it for too long . Mochis are still best eaten fresh. After all, it's not reasonable to compromise on less fresh mochis just because you could get it at a cheaper rate right?"
0,Simina I.,Mochi Sweets,"This boutique is located at the ground floor in The Gardens Mall and is one of my favourite place to buy sweet.

Here you will not find the classic sweets...you will find the best Japanese sweet. If you never had before Mochi, then is time to discover the best sweets ever. Mochi is made form a sticky crust with flour with cheese or white beens and delicious fruits like strawberries, mango, orange, coconut and many other. My favourite ones are the ones with cheese and mango or coconut. I'm not a fan of the ones with white beens.
In case that you don't want to try the delicious Mochi, you can also go for the classic donuts which are are amazing.

The price for a Mochi is around RM3.8 which is not expensive."
0,Stephanie X.,Mochi Sweets,"Mochi is actually a Japanese sweet dessert; mini balls made out of glutinous rice flour filled with different flavors of all sorts. This mini sweet delights are best kept frozen & taken out prior to eating to allow it to defrost for about 15 minutes before you can indulge in them.

The whole texture combined with the flavors of the filling is indescribable. Its like a mini explosion in your mouth I kid you not. Mochi sweets is one of the finer places to get hold of your mochi's. Unlike the frozen ones sold at the supermarkets, these mochi's are much fresher. Of course in terms of pricing they cost way more since it is a specialty store & you are paying for the extra frills such as the classy boxes & individual mochi packing."
0,Harvey T.,Mochi Sweets,"I remember my first time of having this Mochi Sweets when i was in Shanghai during winter, and according to the direction given, i need to wait for 40 minutes just to have this small tiny dessert. The reason to wait here is to ensure the skin of mochi is already soften so you can feel the chewiness of the glutinous. Ever since that, i'm in love with it. From this dessert, i learned that sometimes good food really need to wait patiently.

I love the flavor of cream chocolate which is a little bit bitter of the cocoa powder outside the soft mochi skin but taste sweetness of the chocolate ice-cream inside. There's another new flavor named Matcha Red Bean which also my current favorite.

Each of the Mochi cost in between RM 3.80 to RM 4.80. Recently, there's a 30% discount with purchase of 6 mochi. The packaging is also very nice, red in a box with label of each Mochi's name inside.

If you're have it in Malaysia, you can have it after 20 minutes."
0,James L.,Mochi Sweets,"Ever since my friend introduced this particular dessert to me that is from Hong Kong, I've got so hooked on it! Did you know that Mochi Sweets are all made in HK and shipped in? Yes, this is why their quality is so good.

My favourites are mango and peach. Staffs are always very professional to ask if you want them to take away for long or to eat them straight away. They will give you proper instructions on how long you have to wait before you eat them or if you were to bring it back home to keep."
0,Sara M.,Mochi Sweets,"My first impression of this place was wow! even the delight looked so yummy! the price is really cheaper than I expected, 3.50 to 4 rm per piece is really not much for how the place and he delight looks.

Unfortunately I'm not a Mochi Sweets fan, it;s just not my kind of sweets. I didn't think it was that deliciously sweet. it was just odd."
0,Marija S.,Mochi Sweets,"Who wouln't be interested to try out a delight, when the tag line ls : ""Sweet delights made from glutinous rice flour, pure extraction of fruits, kidney bean and fresh cream.""

Ok I have to say I ignored the kidney bean part as it definitely put me off, but I accept it as a part of different culture and how can you experience a new taste if you only go with what you know, right?

I guess it's just something about Asian desserts and me. I just really don't understand them. I keep on trying hoping that I will learn to appreciate it, but it's a rare case that I would want to repeat after a bite of it.

It is very specific taste, but  if you're a fan of Japanese desserts, I hear that this is a place !:)"
0,Michelle C.,Mochi Sweets,"My experiences buying Mochi from this place can be described in one word. Mediocre. Yes the booth itself is extremely classy in terms of decoration and the staff look extremely clean and hygienic.

However, after spending a steep price on a few flavours, I found the quality very good but it could have been priced lower as I didn't have that ""Eureka "" moment I expected. Some mochi flavours were not sweet enough in my opinion.

Every piece of mochi does come individually packaged and chilled. Maybe mochis just aren't my thing."
0,Jasmine C.,Restaurant DC by Darren Chin,"I have been catching glimpses of reviews and mentions of this place for a few months now and since we had a reason to celebrate, we decided to try this place. contemplated between the 5 and 7 course and ultimately chose the latter as might as well go the way eh?

first off, service was impeccable. our maitre d/ sommielier was very engaging and we truly applaud him for his service during our dinner. another waiter was somewhat perfunctory, but still, polite. The bf and I chose different dishes whenever options were available (i.e for main entree, mains and desserts), so we managed to try everything on the menu. While some of the dishes may not excite in terms of new and exotic ingredients as they believe in sourcing local ingredients but for what it lacks, it makes up in terms of technique and execution. Also, the menu is ever evolving based on the availability of their ingredients.

I personally enjoyed the amuse bouche greatly with poached oyster surprising me with its creaminess and umami-ness. the lamb saddle I had was also memorable, as was the seafood medley. for desserts, the cheese trolley is a fun experience and we loved the cambozola cheese we were recommended. Lovely with the yuzu marmalade served. The other dessert to look out for is the yuba skin with sticky rice and coconut ice cream which is a delicate yet sublime pairing.

even though I walked away a converted diner of DC's, the price will definitely be a deterrent for me to make many return visits. will have to save for another celebratory dinner!"
0,Sue F.,Restaurant DC by Darren Chin,"I reckon it's a bit narcissistic to name a restaurant after yourself and have your photos hanging on the wall of your restaurant. It's the first time I've seen this much self-love from a chef. And the first time I went, they gave me an iPod that had the voice of Patrick Teoh singing praises about the chef. That's a lot of hype for a virtually unknown chef (don't think he's worked at any Michelin-starred places either). But anyway, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and ordered a five-course meal.

The tasting menu was hit-and-miss. I really wanted to love it, but my chicken was overcooked and the flavours in general were just not... memorable. The cheese course was absolutely divine though, I had this creamy French variety which was amazing. The service is stellar too, the manager is very attentive and makes sure he accommodates every table the best he can. But for the price I paid and for how serious everything was, I really didn't have a lot of fun."
0,Richard R.,Restaurant DC by Darren Chin,"If you love Fine Dining Fusion food., this is Must try.
Really passionate and delicious
Very reasonably priced.
Thank you for your passionate chef Darren"
0,Mischa J.,Nasi Lemak Tanglin,"A nice place in the food court area of KLCC mall serving good and affordable Malaysian food... For a drink I had the teh tarik and for food I had some kind of a spicy rice dish with chicken, cucumbers, and nuts..."
0,Yen D.,Nasi Lemak Tanglin,"Everything was great except for the fried chicken.  It was dried out even though the flavor is really good.  For $2 you get the rice, cucumber and ikan bilis.  Read a lot of good things about the fried chicken though but he gave me a random piece.  If it were fresh out of the fryer it would be a 5 star meal.  However the queue was already long and kept increasing when I arrived at noon."
0,Carmen W.,Nasi Lemak Tanglin,"A favourite place of my father's, he will never fail to recount to me how he used to eat their nasi lemak back when the stall was still operating under a tree nearby everytime we head there. It is as if they have him responsible for their success. But I believe that their popularity is solely due to serving really yummy nasi lemak at an reasonable price. Obviously they have long since left the tree to operate in a small food court opposite the Tanglin Hospital. And they are still as popular as ever. I've had occasions when the rice had run out before 11am, so make sure to come here for breakfast. Having it since I was a kid, I can testify that the sambal sotong and the spleen is just the best. You can taste the sweetness the sambal has to offer and the rice is fragrant and fluffy. If spleen is not your thing(it isn't for everyone), they offer other sides as well which is all laid out in front for you to choose. You will not regret it."
0,Simina I.,Iketeru,"If you want to have a romantic dinner in a Japanese style, i recommend you to try this place.
I went here on a date and it was amazing. We stayed on a table outside surrounded by a pond. It was perfect..the view...the food...the music...everything.

The tables inside are quite low, in a Japanese style. The food is heavenly...one of the best restaurants in KL I tried here their Sake, for the first time in my life and I loved it.

The service from staff was excellent. The food came out prompt as well. We had different type of sushi. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. Kudos to the chef!

The price is a little high...but It's Hilton quality, to you have to expect to this.

Overall, this is the perfect place if you want quality Japanese food and are willing to splurge a little."
0,Alexandra M.,Iketeru,"A small group of us went here after work and it was amazing. One of the top 3 Japanese restaurants I have been at.

We had a table inside this little room surrounded by glass walls. The table was really low and the seating place reminded me of the old movies were people ceremoniously kneel down at a tiny table for their dinner.

The food was exquisite and the wine was really good too (not a big drinker but my boss agreed). Some of my colleagues has Sake and quite enjoyed it. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and always there if needed, to make sure we are enjoying ourselves.

We had sushi, barbecued chicken, edamame, you name it. It was a feast! As it is part of the Hilton hotel expect the prices to be on the higher end but the quality will be on par.

The restaurant also has table outside surrounded by a pond, just perfect for a romantic date. The view is spectacular specially at night when all the city lights up. So do book a spot here one day and don't worry about having a hard time finding it. It is right across from Kl Sentral station."
0,Yeoh J.,Iketeru,"Nice place with good ambience. Not too crowded during lunch so would a good place to have lunch for two and chit chat. They have few selections of Japanese beer. Price maybe a bit pricey that the usual restaurant but again, this is in the Hilton hotel itself and standard is there."
0,Jyn-Yann N.,Iketeru,"These days, it's hard to come by good Japanese restaurants. Nowadays, more and more cheap, bad quality restaurants are opening. Iketeru is one of the nicest Japanese restaurants with their ever so fresh sashimi. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The food is good (as expected from a japanese restaurant located in a 5 star hotel).

However, good food comes with a price. The cost of the food at Iketeru is very expensive, I'm not exaggerating. If you aren't really into Japanese, I suggest you go eat at a cheaper Japanese restaurant although the food won't be as good. For those true japanese-lovers (like me), I definitely recommend you to try this restaurant."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Restoran Siu Siu,"Another spot for company lunch as our bosses like Chinese food  a lot.

First thing that attracted me while i was there was their restaurant's pet parrot. So be prepared for its sharp noises during your meals yea.

Expect the big varieties of Chinese food here, and they are really well known for their char siu. Please come earlier if you're purposely here for their char siu, not too fat and very thick cut, not too sweet and really groovy.

Another thing that you can try is their steamed chicken. They have kampong chicken here, so yea they are serious about food!

Other than that i think the other dishes are just ordinary, given the price and the breezy ambience here, it could get quite crowded during lunch time. So don't come too late to avoid waiting for too long."
0,Michelle K.,Restoran Siu Siu,"Yay, I always love Fridays because it means lunch on company! :)

Aww, how much I love my boss!

So, anyway, my boss decided to bring us to Restaurant Siu Siu (Means ""small, small"" in Chinese) in Seputeh. I like the location of the place....it is on an ascending hilly road which makes the place quite breezy. And of course, it is surrounded with lots of greeneries which reminds me of the famous wild boar restaurant - Restaurant Wonderland in Bukit Tinggi.

We had the famous char siew, steamed kampung chicken and a few of the vegetarian dishes. I thought the char siew was way better than the famous char siew in Glenmarie as it is less oil and less sweet. (ps: I hate the fact that the Glenmarie char siew has to be ordered with chicken meat, it comes in combo apparently...and obviously the chicken is just meh)

Anyway, back to Restaurant Siu Siu, I personally like this place and would one day return to try their crabs. Heard that it is really good.

Still not done talking about how great the char siew is...haha...anyway, if you're planning to eat more than 5 pieces of char siew, please order the biggest portion which is RM 30. I like the steamed kampung chicken as it tasted like home-cooked. As for the vegetarian dishes - they were okay. Haha meat lover like me won't comment too much about vegetables."
0,Sara M.,Portofino,"Portofino restaurant is an Italian restaurant with absolutely delicious Italian cuisine one of my favorite cuisine ever. You will be able to find different dishes from Tagliatelle to to their classy pasta with creamy awesome sauces, they even have this creamy potato dish that is out of this world. Its super delicious you must try it. The staff are very helpful and they speak English, they are very welcoming.

The restaurant looks beautiful on the inside they have beautiful tables and chairs very comfortable very classy you can get different dishes at not very expensive prices I believe their dishes are from 25 to 35rm or more depends on your budget so it's an average medium prices restaurant. I definitely recommend the place for anyone who is looking for a nice lunch or a nice dinner, I used to go to Italian restaurant all the time it's super famous in Morocco to just go to Italian restaurants because after all they have one of the best cuisine in the world."
0,Marija S.,Portofino,"Whoop WHoop (a little dance) for a  quite new Italian place in Bangsar!

I love discovering new places, especially those that open in my area.I love even more those that are fantastic :D!

AND yessss this is it! I didn't want to write a review for this restaurant because I don't want it too become crowded :DD But hey, if this might help someone to have a beautiful date in this romantic place - I would be happy to suggest Portofino!

Go with WINE & salmorejo!

It is reasonably priced, the service is high quality and the place is just beautiful.

You will definitely have an experience here. :)"
0,Simina I.,Portofino,"Portofino is a new Italian outlet in Bangsar. Lucky Gardens seems to be going upmarket - it's nice to see a smart and brightly lit restaurant in this area.  Just a few meters from Bangsar Village this Restaurant on 2 levels is a true gem.

Portofino sticks to the Italian classic food. The place provides that kind of home made food cooked by Italian mama, but with the twist of haute cuisine.
The menu offered a fair selection of pastas, salads, risotto, meat, fish and other mains.
My personal favourite are the Seafood Ravioli and the Penne with scallops and pesto. An other absolute must try is in the mouth melting lamb in its own delicious vegetable sauce.

The restaurant is very nice, well-furnished and clean. A perfect place for romance, family and business lunches. Prices are moderate, but quality is top! Great recipe for success!

They have a decent wine list: house pourings start at RM19.90+ by the glass & RM90+ by the bottle.

The place is blessed with a very good staff, very friendly, helpful, informed and enthusiastic.
Definitely somewhere we will go to again, we like it. I'm happy to recommended it to friends."
0,Andy L.,Portofino,"Portofino is your typical Italian restaurant that caters to your typical Italian needs, and while it may seem like a cliche, the food justifies its existence in the neighborhood, and does so very well.

The price is pretty decent for its ambience and the flavor profile it serves there, but that is because I am being kind on this review, for its service is good, and that makes me very happy. The wine choices here are limited, but the food, ranging from your pastas to your obligatory olive oil-based cuisines, are good, and has served itself to be one of the better Italian restaurants around the area.

Of course, that is because it is the ONLY Italian restaurant around the area, thus the claim. Others will be your wishy washy fusion restaurants with their crab pastas and seafood lasagne. Bleh."
0,Ruebni K.,Portofino,"This is one of the places that lets you forget about the stress and worries of the real world and enjoy the comfort of soothing music and tasty food. Worth. Every. Riggit. I ordered the seafod ravioli and my husband ordered the roasted lamb. Really good. The juices were refreshing as well. Guys please check out the place. Very reasonable and trust me, you will definitely feel satisfied."
0,Sabina W.,Mali's Corner,"I really enjoy their chau keuy tiao banjir. The sauce is so tasty!!

I also enjoy their nasi lemak, simple, yummy and effective in filling your tummy!

The place is super popular and the line is usually very long. I say it is worth the wait.

Price is pretty affordable.

Definitely recommend this place!!"
0,Nur Athirah J.,Mali's Corner,"The best char kuey tiaw in town. Everybody's perception when I first asked them about Mali's Corner. First of all, I was so curious about the name. Why Mali, what's Mali. Then only I come to the fact that it is derived from it's owner name : Encik Jamali bin Saad. Well now everything makes sense.

I have this principle of not believing what people said until I myself experienced it. So that's my push factor to go and try Mali's Corner famous char kuey tiaw. When I was there, I found that the surrounding environment is calmly comfortable. The service is also fast. *thumbs up* It's only that took us long for the parking, as the parking area is quite limited. Well, understood.

It's open from 10.00am to 5.00am daily makes all youngsters love to hang around here. The best part is when there's great football games between the giant team, you'll find Mali's Corner full with supporters which sometimes I find attracting. :)

Back to the menu, besides Char Kuey Tiaw, I tried nasi lemak as well since my friend suggested me to. I must say both menus are delightfully tasty, as good as it is serve. I love Malaysian food! I don't think I can survive overseas for a long time because I would be longing for Malaysian's foods so bad. Folks were right, there's no place like home. :)"
0,Everlyn L.,Mali's Corner,"Mali's Corner is best known with its Malay style Char Koay Teow. When I say ""best known"" I really meant it, as this shop has been opened for a long while from a stall opposite TARUC until now, it has few branches in Kuala Lumpur area! Today, the Danau Kota branch even divided into two shops to cook only two food on the menu separately, the Char Koay Teow and Nasi Lemak Ayam.

Its Char Koay Teow is really tasty and full of creamy sauces (that's what makes it sooo special), together with numbers of prawn ad green chilli. It is now available in three sizes, small medium and large. To be honest its small is really small so you better order at least medium if you are not feeling full. Besides, its nasi lemak ayam also tastes nice with its own Sambal sauce! I personally think the dish would be just normal if it serve without the sauce. You can add a fried egg with RM1 extra charges.

Unlike other Malay shops or stalls, it does not offer waiter services, you will need to queue up to order your foods and drinks, pay at the counter and get your meals when they are available. Well, the foods used to be very cheap, but they have raised much for the prices today and I think there are cheaper nasi lemak and fried kuay teow outside. However with its unique recipe, plus long opening hours, there are still many people who patronize this restaurant, just go and try the food there!"
0,Siz L.,Mali's Corner,"Malay style char koay teow with udang banjir in delicious gravy!
Also, nasi lemak with special sweet and spicy sambal (don't forget to add ayam goreng side dish!)"
0,Alfie C.,Mali's Corner,"I was a Penangite before for 2 years. There're lots of things that hardly could forget during my tenure as a Penang citizen. One of them is falling in love with Char Kuew Teow. Char Kuew Teow is basically a Penang food but turns out to be every Malaysian love the taste of the food and decided to sell the sacred meal outside Penang. Nothing can beat the ones from Penang but it doesn't mean the KL ones are not delicious.

Mali's Corner is the one that serve the best Char Kuew Teow in Klang Valley. I went for the closest branch which is located at Danau Kota. This is a self-service type of restaurant. There are 3 options that you have to choose based on their sizes. The small, medium and large. I think the amount of the Char Kuew Teow is just the same but the quantity of shrimps that make thee differences. More shripms inside your plate means that more price you have to pay.

They also serve Nasi Lemak as well and one thing I heard from another customer that their sambal paste is well made and delicious. Will be back for Nasi Lemal later. As for the environment, this place is quite crowded. You have to get in line to get the foods and the drinks. It is not something that I enjoy to do but it seems worth to wait considering the awesomeness of the Char Kuew Teow."
0,Nor Faraniza R.,Mali's Corner,"Yummy! The best char kuew teow  in town! I will always go for special size with extra prawn .And the nasi lemak with fried chicken is also delicious.All meals are hot and freshly cooked.
 Open for long hours ,really helpful when I'm craving in the middle of the night. Sometimes they have baskin  performer to entertain the customer.I love to hang out here for the ambience and the food!
 Price wise very cheap. For less than RM10 you can get meal and drink.Please come and try it yourself!"
0,Amirul R.,Mali's Corner,"For my money, the best single wet kway teow (the Malay variant is nothing like the Penang sort, which I consider the REAL char kway teow) in town. The sauce is absolutely perfect, with generous servings of noodles, prawns and as many chillies as you can dare. It's best enjoyed when it's really, really hot. Don't be discouraged by the long queues -- they move fast!

Oh yeah, and their nasi lemak is easily in the top five best in town."
0,Ryan Q.,Nando's,"Requesting for vegan food at a grilled chicken diner is, what most people would say, is a joke. Nando's do have a few vegan options, mainly wraps, side dishes and salads. I like how their menu states all the food information such as a dish being dairy-free, nut-free or even vegan-friendly as some people may have specific requirements for food due to certain allergies. Their veggie side dishes include roasted veggies, fresh salad, rice,beans, corn on the cob. Though it may seem like a lot, I paid almost RM 7.90 per side dish. And due to it being a SIDE dish, it was a child-like serving size. Eating here would cost a lot, in general, but if there's a certain occasion and there's not much you could do, this would be the solution.

The staff here are attentive and friendly too. Young and also vibrant, they are up to beat with the customers. They even took the time to explain what's good on their menu. Also, if you come here, you HAVE to try out their condiments. Their Peri-Peri sauces are the bomb. It can go from Hot to Extra Extra Hot. Do not be fooled though, these flavors pack a punch and a whole lot of heat."
0,Diana C.,Nando's,"I have really mixed feelings about Nando's.

First, let me tell you about the positives. Nando's serves Portuguese food, which is delicious and offers healthy options, like the sweet mashed potatoes as a side to their signature Peri-Peri chicken. The way the menu works is quite clever, giving you the option of a whole chicken, half or a quarter, and different 'degrees' of spicy. You can also choose from a variety of side dishes, including corn on the cob, rice and others. The ambiance is quite nice in all outlets I've visited.

On the downside, the service is really bad. I've been to multiple outlets and found the service rude, rushed and not very helpful. They have a policy of 'greeting' you by yelling ""Welcome to Nando's"" or something like that, which I find a bit disturbing. Overall, inspite of the service, I really like the food, so I will continue to get my Mild chicken with sweet mashed potatoes."
0,Sara M.,Nando's,"Nando's is Nando's what can I say, if you are in KL and you haven't tried it and especially the peri peri chicken, then you are missing out!! The food is really great, different spices are used to give out amazing taste. I would encourage you to try it out with friends or family.

The staff is friendly and polite. I wouldn't count on getting super fast service but it doesn't take long either. and who cares if the food is worth it right? :D

If you want to get delivery, don't worry about it they provide home delivery. you can even use Food-Panda to find them :) you can call them here (03) 2287 6555."
0,Simina I.,Nando's,"If you wanna enter in the wonderland of chicken and spicy food with amazing flavours, Nando's restaurant is the place. Why? Because they marinate the chicken for 24 hours in a secret sauce until the flavour goes right through to the bone. After that, they flame-grill and basted with your choice of Nando's PERi-PERi sauce. The result is ultimate perfection!

The signature dish of the place is Chicken marinated for at least 24 hours in PERi-PERi sauce and flame-grilled to order.
The PERi-PERi is the heart and soul of Nando's. It's the secret ingredient behind the restaurants and it's so good.

The sauce is delicious with almost anything you want. Nando's range of PERi-PERi sauces combine flavour with varying degrees of heat that will satisfy the flavour profile from a PERi-PERi beginner to a fiery heat seeker.

The price for such an amazing place is between 15-30 RM"
0,Azraai A.,Nando's,"Nando's is one of those fun places you'd go to for peri peri good food and fast service. If you go in the afternoon however I wouldn't recommend sitting outside as it tends to get kind of hot because the outdoor section is situated right beside a the outdoor parking lot.

The last time I was there was with my brother and his now ex-girlfriend and yes, we made the terrible mistake of sitting outside. We ordered our food and the service was extremely fast which was good as we were extremely hungry at the time. The heat combined with the spiciness of our food made us peri peri hot, but it was the good kind of hot. You know the one that usually comes after stuffing yourself to the brim with spicy chicken kind of good. One thing I know, I left the place feeling extremely satisfied!

One thing though, have I gotten big now or are the chicken nowadays getting smaller?"
0,Marija S.,Nando's,"One of the best places to go for Nando's in KL is in Bangsar Village for several reasons:There are no queues, the food is served very quickly and the service is outstanding!

When me and my friend came for the very first time we could not believe it, because it  really didn't feel like usual Nando's experience. It was definitely out of the ordinary. Even the interior of this restaurant was more elegant. I could suggest to bring your date to this Nando!

Something you definitely have to try if you haven't before is: Butterfly chicken with potato wedges and grilled vegetables! I promise you won't regret! :)"
0,Oflavia V.,Nando's,"I am not sure why but nando's service has been dropping down lately. I mean I love the food and I'm sure everyone does and it is not easy to find replacement for nando's, but sometimes their service just make you want to second guess eating here.

I mean, it is not like it is always bad, but last time I went out for lunch with my colleague few months back, we were a group of 8 people, and we sat down on nando's here in Bangsar Village, and called the waiter couple times just to get our order, and we never got any respond for half an hour till we decided to just walk away. So disappointing.

It is like a love and hate relationship. The one in Bangsar doesn't have the best service, I think Nu Sentral has the most awesome service amongst all, but Nando's in Bangsar have pretty decent wi-fi, and when it is not too crowded, then most likely you will get your food and you can sit down quiet and nicely and enjoy their appetising grilled chicken."
0,Nicole S.,Nando's,"Nando's has been present in Malaysia for many years now and is an ever popular favorite for many Malaysians . However I feel that over the years the portions have been getting smaller and smaller as opposed to the price which has been increasing.  A couple of years ago, I could order an Ala Carte 1/4 chicken and be full but now days I find myself ordering a 1/4 chicken and 2 sideline and only being satisfied with my meal.

The service her is terrible. Most of the waiters are slow and chose to ignore the customers. I have seen on more than one occasion where a waiter has seen a customer and just turned their head in the other direction and walk away.

Though the portions have gotten smaller, the quality has remained the same, which is good as i have yet to find anything that tastes as good as nandos chicken."
0,Alexandra M.,Nando's,"Suffice to say that every time my boyfriend wants to go for lunch for some reason he wants to go to Nando's.

I know what's the reason but  so every time we are near the mall and if there's a Nando's around we have to try the food. His favourite meal  is the one you can share for only RM55. You can actually have a whole chicken and you can choose from 4 side or 2 specialty sites.

The restaurant is really neat and really pretty, they have a really nice decorations inside and we to love their hot sauce. We even buy them for cooking at home. The restaurant has really good food and the prices are pretty good. You can even have a meal between RM12 to RM15 or you can choose one of the shared plates."
0,Julian T.,Nando's,"Oh my Nandos. Feel like eating half a chicken? Come to Nandos, thats what I do anyways. No doubt, Nandos is known for their Peri-Peri sauce, which starts off from Lemon & Herb, Mild, Hot, and Extra Hot. I really like how I can choose how my chicken taste like depending on my mood.

A normal set here includes the chicken, and sides of your choice. The fries here are really good, and you can ask for more Peri Sprinkles, which is the seasoning. If you prefer to feel healthier, you can also get the grilled vegetables, but why?? Just kidding, vegetables are good.

You can also opt for a bottomless drink, but I usually do fine with just a glass of plain water. Yes! One of those rare places that lets you get plain water. I don't know about other outlets though."
0,Shearlee L.,Nando's,"Not a fan of Nando's? Then gurlll you gotta set that straight.

What I ALWAYS order when I come here is the quarter chicken, (half when I'm feeling greedy, and end up regretting because I can't finish), you have the choice of either Lemon & Herb, Mild, Hot, or Extra Hot PERi-PERi sauce of which I obviously go for Hot or Extra Hot, with my sides of regular chips and grilled vegetables, and there you go, all your daily nutrition needed on one plate. The chips is made very basic with simple seasoning, but what I truly appreciate is that my fries are never soggy and oily. The grilled vegetables though slightly oily, is still my fav because your vegetables are accentuated by the smokey flavor and it is seasoned well. The butter rice is pretty good too.

Quite frankly, the main reason why I am such a die-hard fan is because of their Peri Peri sauces. My must haves would be the Garlic and Extra Hot, it goes so well together and it is worth the sting and burn on my lip. Whoever created this heavenly blend of ingredients is god-sent because you can purchase them at supermarkets and it goes well with just about any meat you cook and is a savior for anything.  

It is priced below RM20 for a quarter chicken set, and about RM7.90 for a bottomless soft drink."
0,Joanna N.,Nando's,"Whenever I feel like having grilled chicken, I just know I'll get the most satisfaction at Nando's. Their peri-peri chicken is always, and I mean always, grilled to perfection. And the home sauce at Nando's is just as amazing. They serve their chicken according to one's taste for spiciness by using one of four different flavors of sauce for the chicken; lemon and herb, mild, hot or extra hot peri-peri sauce.

The service at the Bangsar Village outlet is very good as they are quick to serve you your food and I like the fact that it is not usually crowded. Also, seeing that it is in Bangsar Village, parking is not a problem."
0,Wen H.,Nando's,"Nandos one of my favourite place to dine in. Quater peri peri chicken with coleslaw and nandos chip is my all time  food order. Succulent chicken with crunchy skin is really delicious. I particularly love their chips because it is thick and soft inside and it is sprinkled with peri peri powder. If you like rice, you can order the mediterranean rice as your side dishes. All the outlets at nandos is pretty much on the same standard. They have their signature sauces hot, garlic, and extra hot peri peri sauce. I usually mix both garlic and extra hot peri peri by far the best combination. You can always opt for your favourite part of the chicken that you wanna eat either thigh of breast."
0,Wye Mun K.,Sisters Noodles @ Beh Brothers Restaurant,"The best Curry Mee that I've had so far!! The Sisters Noodles have been around for 20 years and is located in Jalan Alor. A must go to place for all the Curry Mee lovers out there. The curry is just superb! Make sure you ask for Wanton noodles for your Curry Mee rather than Meehoon or Yellow Mee! The Curry Mee comes along with their Sambal which you definitely go asking for more once you've tried it. Great portions with generous amount of ingredients such as cockles, steamed chicken and taufu.

Apart from the Curry Mee, they are also known for their Drunken Chicken Noodles if you're not a Curry lover. The Drunken Chicken Noodles comes with a fried egg as well but it's rather pricey at RM12.00 the last time I had it.

0,Michelle C.,Hoji & Matcha,"When it comes to Japanese food, why play it safe. At Hoji and Matcha you can unleash your adventurous side. Although not everything on their menu is experimentative and outlandish, hubby and I decided to give their squid ink spaghetti a go.

It came black as night and tasted like the sea. hubby liked it but I couldn't stomach a second bite and went back to my boring old Kare raisu (curry rice). His lips were tsained black at the end of the meal, like he was wearing gothic black lipstick. You should have been there.

Anyway, we went all courageous and called their shoyu (that's soy sauce) ice cream. Aha, soy sauce and ice cream or not two words that go together but when it comes to the Japanese, anything goes, It was actually delicious! Not too sweet and the salty soy sauce undercurrent really gave an asian kick to it."
0,Ryan Q.,Hoji & Matcha,"An avid food go-er when it comes to Japanese cuisine, I'm fond of all the remixed versions of traditional foods. What a nice way to spruce up the ordinary. As this cafe is taking up Sri Petaling by storm, I explored deeper into their renowned theme of dishes basing upon Matcha, which is basically Japanese Green Tea.

Upon entering the cafe, I saw this whole decked out corner of Japanese treats, ranging from the over-rated KitKat in a green tea flavor, some munchies, Japanese snacks, seaweed and so on. They even sold green tea as well as sesame sauce that they put in salads.

Moving on to the food, I took one of their ' Agedashi Tofu ' which is one of their specials.It's just some fried tofu with some sweet sauce. Surprisingly, it wasn't greasy nor did it feel heavy. My cousin had their squid-ink pasta, which looked gross because everything was black. But he seemed to enjoy it. My aunt had the Chicken Katsu which she said was ordinary. However, the green tea here is VERY authentic. It had a slight bitterness to it which I had to get used to.

Prices here are affordable, but as for their desserts, it's a bit upscale considering the portions were quite small."
0,Jesslyn C.,Hoji & Matcha,"Hoji and Matcha is a little different when compared to the legion of cafe chains located in Bandar Baru Sri Petaling. Serving up Japanese themed drinks and desserts, this adorably named outlet is quick on it's way to becoming one of Petaling's most renowned cafe. From what I've heard, Hoji and Matcha is usually crowded over the weekends (with little or no parking spaces around at all) so my friends and I decided to pay them a visit on a Tuesday. There was still a surprising amount of people present though, but finding a space wasn't very difficult.

The entrance of Hoji and Matcha just happens to be decked with a stunning variety of Japanese snacks, candy, biscuits, and many more colorful items that I couldn't place. Hoji and Matcha's menu consisted if not only drinks but also various brunch items, ice cream and a couple of noodle dishes as well. I was a little lost when it came for me to finally order up, but the patient and friendly servers there recommended I try their famous Iced Matcha Latte Float which costed me around RM12. It looked pretty appetizing at first, but be warned! The matcha latte tends to be MUCH more bitter than it is sweet. I did struggle with chugging it down at first, but got used to it's taste over time. For all you green tea enthusiasts out there, Hoji and Matcha is a must try."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,Hoji & Matcha,"Participating in the Green Tea boom in Malaysia, we have Hoji & Matcha. Focusing on these two, their dishes revolve around Hoji and Matcha as their main ingredients.

Walking into the cafe which is situated directly opposite of Public Bank (I have to warn you that parking is an issue), you will notice a mini market selling snacks and drinks imported from Japan. Yes, that means you'll be able to get your Green Tea Kit Kat here! Sadly, the price of the snacks here is a bit more expensive.

I tried out their lunch set promo, RM12.90++ for a main course and drink. I ordered the Teriyaki Salmon Rice Set and picked a Matcha Latte to go with. The rice was unusually dry, I say unusual because Japanese rice are known for being moist and plump. But this was quite the opposite. The Teriyaki Salmon was delightful! It was well seasoned and not too strong on the teriyaki taste.
My Matcha Latte had more of a bitter taste than sweetness, but I guess that is what green tea is known for. The slight bitterness and earthy taste.

The staffs are very friendly. They were so patient when it came to explaining the menu to me when I asked."
0,Andy L.,Hoji & Matcha,"Hoji & Matcha, as the name states, is a cafe that solely focuses on the greatness of green tea, and green tea only, and celebrates its 'greatness' through a variety of food.

With the iced matcha latte float being one of their main specialties, the shop also compliments the drink with matcha desserts that really makes it special to eat there. Of course, the drink itself tastes heavenly, with the ice cream really juxtaposing with the rich and creamy taste of the drink itself due to its near to flawless froth that forms around it. Other than that, there are also other green tea related dishes that are bound to tickle your tea leaf love.

That being said, I really enjoyed this place, and you should come here with all the friends you can bring to try this pretty decent place."
0,Chun Ynh C.,Bruno's Steaks and Burgers,"The steak is very super juicy and the duck is one of a kind! Get the knockout (whole duck breast) - it comes with unlimited tortillas. Surprisingly, its super tender.

As for the steak, it's heavenly. And at this price range, and if you dont mind a street food kind of location, then you will defnitely love this place. Will come back again."
0,Andy L.,Bruno's Steaks and Burgers,"If you have watched the movie Chef, chances are you noticed a food truck that placed itself in Desa Sri Hartamas, serving high quality burgers and steaks to the hungry ones.

In Bruno's Steak and Burgers, its notion goes far beyond the name itself. I, for one, loved the fact that they are serving steaks of such calibre on a food truck, a view that would have long been shunned a decade ago. I ordered their Mafia, a burger that is stacked with beef patties, eggs and cheese, and it tastes akin to the Heavens opening its gates for you. Its succulent yet slightly rough meat is perfectly cooked to complement all meat eaters, and is bound to make you come back for more. The other dish that really caught me off guard is its rib-eye steak; I ordered it medium rare, and its constrained bloody meat is delicious, and is a kick to the arses of TGIF and Tony Roma's for them not delivering the same standard as Bruno's.

Expect this food truck to become one of the most sought after places for the carnivores, and become the next big thing apart from the dull boat noodles and the usual Korean BBQ. Do give it a try when you are near this area, for you will live to regret it if you do not."
0,Peisa M.,Quivo,"Cool place, good vibe and very good food. Salads here are my favorite because the greens are very fresh. I specially enjoy the churrasco steak salad. I like it rare and the meat cut skirt steak is very tender and juicy. Love their mango smoothies very refreshing!

For those who want something more than a Tiger or Carlsberg you can also find some good imports for example, Erdinger German Weißbier. Nice crisp and refreshing on a hot day!"
0,Umar R.,Quivo,"What stands out gastronomically at quivo is the burgers and the salads, I was not that impressed with their pizza, pasta and risotto, now don't get me wrong it was delicious and the ingredients were great but it did not leave an everlasting impression. What also lacks from quivo is the service, the waiters are great here, however when it comes to water, they are seriously stingy like it's gold that they are pouring, water had to be requested every time, and every time there was a delay.

Now back to food - the burgers here is delicious and flavourful, and was impressively served on a wooden board, with aesthetics in detail, wedges was served in a mini deep fryer basket, salad on the side and burger looks juicy and sexy upon arrival. My recommendation would be the wagyu  beef piquente cheese burger, rm 40 - steep for a burger price but it's delicious , trust me.

The beef brisket risotto was lacking lots of flavour and felt very bland for rm42. I felt like there was hardly any mushrooms added, and it was just too creamy, and lacks taste or flavour, all i tasted was cream and fat, and while the brisket was beautifully done, it also lacked substantial flavour - in other words it was so boring.

The pizza - also a let down , took 45 minutes to be served to the table and it was lacking toppings, even Pizza Hut was more generous. I tried the hot stuff rm 38 pizza - it was nice but topping was pretty skimpy and the flavour did not make my taste buds wake up. And I think the wait was unnecessarily too long.

Now their service is not terrible, friendly staff, but they seem to be lacking in training when it comes to follow up, there was no table check up and topping off water through your my dining, I find myself consistently begging for water. And while their seats is beautiful, I do find that the place lacks detail, there was a cigarette mark on our table - felt so Dodgy in my opinion.

Quivo is located right behind Kate spade and along the main pavilion walk way , you can't miss it. What's great it they open all day , but what's socks would be their price and their stinginess when it comes to water. I like their burgers tho and salad, so I might be back."
0,Gouthaman K.,Quivo,"This was ok. Me and a friend chose this spot to catch up over some beer and it was mostly good but a few things cost the two stars.

Service was was very slow to the point where you'd have to struggle to get someone's attention. I guess they were having a busy day but things weren't exactly quick once we got here.

We ordered some beer and a couple of appetizers to nibble on. The Onion Rings were great but it was weird that we got BBQ sauce as a dip in a restaurant that's supposedly mediterranean -- there's so much flavour from that part of the world and BBQ sauce seems like the last thing you'd expect from a place like this.

The second starter we ordered was the Mezze Platter. It was largely good but apparently they ran out of the Baba Ghanoush. No one bothered to tell this to us and we simply got served the platter with a weird mashed Tomato Chutney in place of the Aubergine goodness I was expecting.

Quivo isn't particularly cheap, but I'm willing to pay the price for good food or service. The food here was mostly good except those concerns I've listed above and the service was sub-par."
0,Robin G.,Quivo,awesome food and the coolest drinks! i would definitely return. The salad I had was huge and very delicious.
0,Nicole S.,Quivo,"Quivo serves Mediterranean inspired food, with a little western twist. So they serve burgers etc. but with some Mediterranean elements like spices in the patty. Its pretty much a fusion restaurant. We were quite intrigued when the outlet opened at pavilion, just below Kate Spade, and a long the walk way heading to the fountain. The restaurant's deco looked funky and inviting, like we wanted to know more about this place.

So like a week after that we decided to go to Quivo for dinner. We had a Mediterranean lamb burger, a pasta and a dessert. Honestly the pizza and pasta were good, not memorable though. The dessert however was amazeballs! it was a chcolate, oreo, cream concoction and I can start drooling just thinking about it. Its really something different that I've not seen served anywhere else.

Its about RM50 per person here of course that depends on what you order. Will definitely be back here soon for more dessert!"
0,Tony V.,Quivo,"I wandered by here and was pulled in by very friendly staff. It was mid afternoon so was not very crowded. I sat in the bar and tried the Chicken Wings which were very good. Spicy but not too hot with a great flavor.

I had a great table for people watching as they came and went from the mall. This is an open air restaurant but you are sitting inside if it starts to rain as it does almost every afternoon in KL.

I would recommend it for a quick stop and snack. The only distraction is the construction going on next door, but the friendly and helpful staff overcame the noise for me to still enjoy my time."
0,Ian L.,Quivo,"This spanking new place in Pavilion Shopping Mall is hard to miss. The Mediterrean-inspired restaurant and bar, which shares the same space as Kate Spade, is nothing short of quirky, fun and chic.
  We really enjoy the overall décor here: 3D floor tiles, bright-red high-stools, and cozy lightings. It's all tastefully done without being too kitschy. The outdoor seating area is best for people watching while you sip on a glass of cocktail.
The fruity cocktails on menu immediaty caught our eyes (and thirst). Make sure you try The Mangosteen Mai Tai and Banana Colada."
0,Eveline L.,Quivo,Quivo is THE PLACE TO dine in when you are in Pavilion! Their food is tasty but prices are not too expensive. Service is good here as the waiters are friendly and food is served pretty quick. However one might find it hard to locate Quivo. You may enter via Kate Spade or through the alfresco area.
0,Thomas P.,Quivo,"I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves this for the excellent food and attentive service.
It is a little hidden due to the current construction but worth looking for it next to Kate Spade.

See my tip for the best salad in town- I also likes the brisket burger and the tenderloin skewer.

The portions are on the small side but this way you get to try the deserts!

Avoid the bar area as there smiling is permitted."
0,Eziq M.,Quivo,Lamb souvlaki was a great choice. The lamb patty was tender and chips was crispy.  Overall satisfied with the food served.
0,Ronnie S.,Baba Low Bangsar,"First rate spot! I'm not raised on this, but I know good food in a good setting! Easy to like. Menu isn't hard to figure and plenty of pictures help. Friendly staff, fast service. Amazing Cendol. It's as if they had fresh snow. Very refreshing. I'll never look at a Slurpy the same again!"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Sae Ma Eul,"Loving the grilled meat here, period.

As you know, Mont Kiara is an area that's filled with heaps of Korean eateries - and it's not easy to say which one is the best. However, Sae Ma Eul is definitely one of my favourites right now. Good quality meat, fresh seafood, nice pickles, the make-you-happy rice balls, friendly service - you name it.

Of course, I must admit that there might be some undue influence right here, as I came here after drinking with friends at Oktoberfest - but how could you resist Korean BBQ after  some beers?

One thing that I would definitely recommend here apart from their grilled meat, which is a must order, would be their rice balls. You will be given a pot of rice with condiments on top, and a pair of plastic gloves. Slip them over your hands, and there you go! Like your rice hot and warm? Grill it! I love mine, like literally.

Another great thing would be that they are opened until past midnight, which is a big plus for all those who crave for some good grilled meat at wee hours.

Price wise, it's pretty fair as well. The only thing that would cause a headache would be getting a parking here - good luck!"
0,Shuen P.,Sae Ma Eul,"Never really a fan of Korean food. Got to know about this place from my colleague. She found it through some food blog and insist that we (the whole team) shall try them out together.

So yeah, we went to give it a try and at the same time have some bonding session. Well, I like bonding session, where we can talk nonsense and have fun together.

Okay, back to the food! We ordered 2 sets of the BBQ set which comes with some pork and octopus, some chicken, more pork, the famous seaweed rice balls (2 sets for the 8 of us) and 2 types of soup to share.

The fun part about this place is making the rice balls. You have to make your own rice balls by squeezing them with your hands (plastic gloves provided). My overly excited colleague is assigned the rice ball making task while the rest of us bbq the pork and of course, enjoy eating too. Hehe..
*tips* make sure the rice ball is a little burnt, it's tastier that way where it's crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside!

Enjoyed our bonding session over food very much but I find that their food wasn't that superb, just that the concept where we have to bbq our own food and make our own rice balls is quite interesting. Well, I hardly go for Korean and whenever I do, I usually goes to Daorae where the food are BBQ-Ed by the waiter. All I need to do is wait and eat. Heheh.. Hence, this is quite new to me.

Great experience and worth trying if you've yet to try it but I don't think that I'll purposely come all the way here just for this though."
0,Ong P.,Sae Ma Eul,Visited this place on a Sat night after watching the final episode of Descendants of the Sun. Pretty hard to find parking and many people double parked and left their contact number on their dashboard. Their Korean BBQ is delicious with reasonable price. Only 4 dishes of refillable side dishes were served. Their meat is really fresh and we liked its soy sauce marinated meats! Do get there early if you decide to go on weekend!
0,Vanessa O.,Sae Ma Eul,"The queue is definitely long for korean bbq and this is one of the classic example that Sae Ma Eul Yeo Pe can offer. This shop is slightly small to accommdate the demand especially during weekends or public holidays. This shop is located at Solaris Dutamas and it is one of the hangout place for Koreans and locals.

This bbq concept is different from what you get at Palsaik because this is grilled using charcoal. More authentic I find it comparing to the grilling by gas. You can order from their menu that range from meat to seafood and the menu has more options for you to choose.

Price doesn't come cheap but to me it is reasonable because you get to experience something different and you don't eat this on a daily basis. Vegetables (lettuce) are usually very fresh and you can ask them to top it up as much as you need.

Overall, I'm loving this place very much!"
0,Jen L.,Sae Ma Eul,"I am a fan of Korean food but i can't remember a single dish in Korean. this does not make sense. Of all many korean BBQ shops around here, only this is full house and crowded. I passed by this place so many times but never had a chance to try it but thanks to Yelp Events, i finally manage to try it.

Ordered the BBQ set which is about RM50 something for baby octopus, free flow of vege and garlic and meat of course. Our table was really space constraint and luckily we were sitting near the counter top. The used charcoal as fire and a net for use to cook, here nobody will help you cook so be careful and i personally think that the ventilation is a no go because when the fire gets big, it goes to the side and the ventilation doesn't suck so much of the fire. We burned some meat and over cook the octopus but it's ok, still edible.

As for the noodles, we ordered a dish called rice ball where you put on gloves and make your own rice ball mix with seaweed rice and chilli paste, the kimchi is really crunchy and spicy and cold,LOVE IT! Also, we ordered pork spicy soup, it was good and buckwheat cold noodle which is a combination of sweet and sour soup. I also heard that the Ramen here is good but didnt manage to eat this time as our table is full.

Came home and smelled like bbq but it was fun and exciting."
0,Alexis G.,Sae Ma Eul,"I like the whole street side shopping experience of this place! With most Korean BBQ place being indoor, poshy and comfortable, this place offers a twist to the whole experience by offering street food like sensation for their customers. Sit by the space at the corner outlets with steel tables and stools and start your BBQ session. You'll feel like you're eating in Korea in no time.

They offer main dishes for you so you can get a bit filled up before you start your BBQ session. Order some kimchii friend rice, pancake or even cold buckwheat noodle. I have a thing for their buckwheat noodle though, gosh the noodle is just slurpy and smooth with a yummy dressing to match. There are many choices of meat and vegetables but the portion is really small hence is serving won't feed a hungry strong man but for the ladies, well just maybe it's enough. So if you wanna munch on meat it might rake up some $$$. One pro tip though, park at Soho KL if you don't want to stress on getting a space and order some makgeolli when you have your meal. It's the best match, ever!"
0,Vivian Y.,Sae Ma Eul,"This place was really packed. The service was pretty good though, employees were really quick on their feet on cleaning up, getting you seated and cooking your food. They have a decent set with pork and octopus which cost 55rm that is suitable for 2-3 people. Those rice balls cost like 20rm. You would have to cook the food and make the rice balls yourself but it's pretty enjoyable. I think it's part of the fun with this Korean barbecue place.

The parking can be a little bit of a pain. People would double park everywhere for this place."
0,Angeline C.,Sae Ma Eul,"This is my first review, so I am going to let Sae Ma Eul to be my first review, it is located at Solaris, it is at a corner but its not hard to notice, I had been supporting them before they got well known, so I know the boss for quite some times,

their food are the same with those we usually went ( those expensive until you think you going to wash dishes for them) but to be honest their price is really reasonable! rm27 for thick piece of pork, rm13 for broth noodle, and to be honest, the boss is super nice! :) I can't think of anything to rate them bad. their food and people are awesome, if you are a big fans of korean drama and stars, this is a place for you, (no, there is no korean celebrity) BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IS THERE, what I mean is, they are open air surrounding, so you can smoke (if you are a smoker) and their restauarant provide Wi-fi if you insisted to get connected and show this place through your social media platform :) I highly recommend you guys to try their rice wine, trust me, it taste super nice! even perfect when you are bbq-ing!"
0,Julian T.,Sae Ma Eul,"I am a big fan of barbeques. Being able to grill your own food at a restaurant is awesome! This corner lot in Solaris Mont Kiara is where you should be if you're a fan of Korean BBQ. There is a constant queue every time its open, sometimes even before it opens. Stools are provided for those who are waiting, considerate.

The prices for meat here are quite expensive, but is definitely worth it. The grill is cleaned if there is a previous customer and fresh coals are added. The food you ordered arrives almost instantly most of the time. Standard korean side dishes are served and are refillable.

The meat was perfectly marinated, guaranteed to satisfy your umami buds. Plain water are constantly refilled on your table, but I'm sure you can order other drinks too. Remember not to dress to heavily as the heat will get the sweat out of you."
0,Foodie C.,Sae Ma Eul,"If you know korean food, this place is Meh~~~~!!!!

1. Staff service was not bad.

2. I had better korean food in KL. Quality is not so good. I guess you get what you pay for. It is just cheap but nothing else. If you wanna go for quantity and cheap food this is for you. I rather pay a bit more and have better quality food.

3. Atmosphere was fun."
0,Vivian W.,Sae Ma Eul,I love the environment in this restaurant. Simple gives you the feeling of cooking and chilling at the same time. The food is ok. Weekends are always full. I always go during weekdays
0,Sara M.,Sae Ma Eul,"My friends have been raving about this place for the longest time I wanted to see what the hype was all about so I suggested that we have dinner here for our monthly gathering. Parking is a real pain here, I drove around for almost 45 minutes hunting for a proper parking space. It's best not to park illegally because the policemen in the area are very diligent. One of my friends went earlier around 6.30pm to get a table, this place is usually very crowded especially and they don't take reservations, tables are on a first come first serve basis. The BBQ grill is super basic, literally a wire netting over charcoal fire it wasn't what I've expected at all.

The prices here are abit on the pricey side, we ordered the set meal which consist of two pork chops, two slices of bacon and two baby octopus. We also added a few ala carte items such as the marinated pork and some seaweed rice ball dish. By the time our food arrived the place was packed and there was already long line of people waiting in line to get a table. So the set meal arrived first, I understand that the pork chop would come whole but the octopus too? We had no idea how to cook the octopus (yes you have to barbeque your own meat, this is not like those other Korean BBQ places where they cook your meal in front you), we just placed the octopus on the grill and hoped for the best. The pork chops were alright but the bacon wasn't, it was chewy and the amount of fat on the meat made it worst. The octopus was surprisingly tasty though.

Halfway through the meal the waiter brought over a big bowl of rice and a pair of plastic gloves. He left it on the table without saying a word. We stared at the bowl, puzzled. So we look around at the other table and realized that it was the rice balls that we ordered. The waiters we rolling the rice into balls for the other tables so we flagged down a waiter and asked him to assist us as it was our first time ordering this dish. He asked us to do it ourselves as he as way busy, we pointed out that other waiters we helping the other tables why couldn't he but he still insisted that he was busy and couldn't help us, then he walked away. Geeze! We managed to get another waiter to help us with the rice ball, he too was reluctant at first but obliged in the end. So was it worth all the frustration for the rice balls? Nope not really. They tasted like white rice mixed with sambal ikan bilis. Nothing special.

I usually love eating Korea BBQ, but gosh! This was a really bad experience."
0,Zilin C.,Sae Ma Eul,"Another authentic Korean restaurant in Mont Kiara area that I really love. Came here for a friend's birthday dinner one weeknight and it was packed. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to free up and it was 5 of us to one table. Managed to get an outdoor table which we were looking out for anyway as we were going to be barbequeing some meat and wanted fresh air.

What's interesting about Sae Ma Eul is that, unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants, you grill your meats over an actual metal grill plate over hot coal fire, so your meat cooks faster and the oils drip back down through the grill into the fire and keeps it burning all night!
The meat here tastes so good when grilled the traditional way.. we were all so full by the time we'd finished.
They also serve alcohol here so we had a few cans of Tiger beers to go with our meats. The spicy belly was the highlight of the night - so fatty yet so juicy and tender after being cooked for less than 10 minutes.
We loved every bit of this restaurant, however it can get super hot outside especially with the fire in your face, so if you're planning on coming here be prepared to have your clothes smell like BBQ and be prepared also to be sweating throughout the night.
The staff here are very helpful - once we needed help with cutting the cooked meats as we were afraid of burning ourselves and one of the waitresses came and did it for us in less than 5 minutes! She must be so used to other customers asking her to do the same.
Although the range of Korean restaurants in Mont Kiara is extensive, if you're looking for some authentic Korean with a unique experience, I'd definitely recommend Sae Me Eul!"
0,Andy L.,Sae Ma Eul,"Meh.

Korean food is always my Achilles heel, because I dislike anything that is both sweet and savory. Of course, Sae Ma Eul offers both things at the same time along with the dreaded BBQ, which admittedly tasted as good as it looks. The side dishes tasted just average to the mouth, but if you are a huge fan of Korean food, then yes, the side dishes will tickle your fancy. With the ambience being less private due to the open air environment, everything you taste contains copious amount of carbon monoxide of cars passing by and other harmful things hanging in the air. Yes, it does give you a better ambience, but hygiene-wise?

No. Just no. Perhaps I will enjoy it better if I am a sucker for Korean food, but I am not, which made my life sad. Sad indeed."
0,Jay O.,Sae Ma Eul,"My colleagues/friends and I were here for a meet up, catching up . Sae Ma Eul is located at Solaris, Mont Kiara and quite an assuredly corner that are super easy to be discovered. Thanks to my colleagues/friends, I once again witness the true Korean Food. YUM!

Since it was my first time here, my colleagues/friends were ordering. They first ordered a cold chilly noodle (Mmmm, Must try) , Gae Jang (Beef soup) as our appetizer.  Next, we continued with humongous pieces of pork (RM 27), beef and fresh octopus as our main course along with a bowl of piquant seaweed rice - it is eaten in a rice ball form where we used our glove to actually rolled it. It's one of the BEST Korean bbq I tried in my life!!!!! Their amazing tender pork and beef, is incredible. Not to mention, their remarkable kimchi that are breathtaking - they have the prefect kimchi, I am not even KIDDING! Plus, their boss and staff here are extremely friendly. There's a smoke spot for the smokers (yeah for them) and wifi are even provided. Ain't it great? They charges at a reasonable price for their food as well.

If you are a die hard Korean Fan, you are been warned. You might fall for this restaurant intensely. So, are you ready for a Korean food invasion?"
0,Sara M.,Dôme,"One of my favourite places to sit and work in KL. I love the spaces they have outside of the restaurant itself, especially on a chill day with breeze. you hardly get those around here but when they do come! it's perfect.

I love their chairs and the way their restaurants make me feel like I have been taken to a different dimension of time where the world is chill modern but with an old touch. I am huge fan of coffee but what's more I'm a huge fan of coffee and milk which we call back home 'Café Crème', Since i got to KL I never found what's the name for that in English or whatever language. then for some reason at Dôme one day I just decided to go for Latte because sometime I do like to stir away from coffee, let me explain, back home, Latte is simply milk with some flavour of your choice, so it can be Vanilla Latte or Caramel Latte, then i actually got my favourite 'Café Crème', I was so surprised and happy and I couldn't complain! since then Dôme became my favourite cafe! not to mention the service is just impeccable!"
0,Cole D.,Dôme,"This is a mix of European , Malaysian and authentic local food. Very, very good and .... Let's face it, as Americans traveling abroad you must be a bit cautious of the water and ice served.... But not here. Everything top notch and no worries what we ate or drank. Find this spot and enjoy the food!!"
0,Jason D.,Sitka Restaurant,"I was brought to this place by a local friend on my first trip to Malaysia. The food was just amazing, we ordered a number of dishes to share and I wasn't disappointed by any of them. The egg dish (I don't remember the name) was my favorite, they combined radishes and yams in place of fried potatoes.

From the first plate to the dessert I was impressed. I really appreciated the lack of pretense, just outstanding food in a nice relaxing atmosphere."
0,Jasmine C.,Sitka Restaurant,"I love how the old shops at Jalan Batai are being revamped. So much more interesting places popping up an Sitka was one of the first. I have been going back whenever I am in the neighborhood and I love that they still have something on the menu to excite me. Found the place first when I had this craving for lobster roll (after a particularly memorable one in Melbourne) but must admit theirs was lacklustre. But instead, found other things on the menu such as the millet salad which I love.

This time we also tried one of their mains, the seabass. And though the fish was perfectly cooked, the seasoning was a bit too strong for my liking. Still, am curious about their test kitchens which I hope to try one day. Our dessert probably saved the meal... with the fun looking banana cake.

Scandinavian decor is also lovely, but can be a bit noisy when they are a few groups of people at the same time. Parking has been reasonably easy for me mostly."
0,Sue F.,Sitka Restaurant,"I've been to Sitka multiple times now and I love it. I was chuffed about them opening because they serve great salads, which I find is usually an afterthought in so many cafés. The salads (I love the chickpea one!) are well prepared and substantial enough for a light lunch. The fried chicken, lobster roll and tacos are excellent too, but my favourite daytime entry has got to be the caprese sandwich. It's basically a caprese salad in sandwich form, which reads delicious. Plus, they use a lot of local produce, which is something that's important to support.

The test kitchen menus at night is another reason Sitka is a great restaurant. The chef goes a bit crazy in the kitchen trying to come up with modern European dishes using local produce. The results are always fascinating - like the cauliflower with ground nuts, or the white chocolate panna cotta with wood sorrel. Prices are pretty reasonable too for the quality you're getting - I reckon it's definitely one of the more underrated restaurants in town."
0,Fairuz Z.,Sitka Restaurant,"Good coffee, nice interior but too damn noisy. People nowadays have no common sense. If u decided to come to some fancy place, please bring along your common sense."
0,Shearlee L.,Sitka Restaurant,"Seated in the same row with 30-year old shops, Sitka is one of those cosy neighbourhood eateries that has capture the hearts of loyal customers. I was surprised with the obscure location that was going through some major renovation but the place was not once empty when I visited, be it little business meetings, luncheon amongst a group of dames, or solitary visitors that sipped coffee in tranquil.

What truly blew me away was the Soft Beef Tacos. Served on paper on top of a wooden board, my taco had shredded beef brisket, green onion, feta, radish for a touch of color, and unseen was the amazing beef jus that oozes out everytime you bite into it. Seasoned perfectly, the beef is so tender and moist, every bite was just so good that I was upset I only had two on my board. At RM25, two piece of tacos won't get you full but I assure you it's sublime flavors and quality. The other dish I thought was delicious was the Fried Chicken - half buttermilk spring chicken with honey & thyme that is fried to perfection. It is lightly battered, not greasy, extremely crispy, and oh-so juicy and succulent that is extraordinary for something that's been deep fried. Though it is on the sweeter side, I was very impressed with the expertise shown in this dish. Yet again, priced at RM23, you won't get full by eating this alone. We ordered the Mango with Charred Red Onion Couscous in hopes to fill our tummies but couldn't quite get the hang of the combination of flavors and textures. I've also tried the Softshell Crab Steamed Bao that was just so-so.

I wouldn't suggest you to visit when you are starving because of it's price and quantity, but I would definitely recommend you to come here just for the Beef Taco & Fried Chicken."
0,Michelle C.,Dastarhan,"I admit I've never had Russian food before I came here, so it was an eye opening experience for me. In addition to Russian food, they also serve some dishes from Kazakhstan. Dining here has really been one of the most memorable and adventurous experiences of my life since Russian food is so rare in Malaysia.

Anyway, I recommend the Borscht, a red beet soup that has a fiery colour and even better taste. I absolutely love when I have Shelpek bread dipped into the Borscht. Yes, people, order the Shelpek bread. A buddy of mine who used to work in Central Asia absolutely gobbled up about 8 pieces of this Shelpek bread and loved it.

Service here is excellent and the servers will definitely grab a chance to explain their eating culture to you and chat you up on Kazakhstan culture. Once the owners even offered us some freshly baked cookies that were not on the menu.

The salads are great too and my favourite is the Olivier Salad made with potatoes. My other favourite dish is the Cutleti, which is minced meat. Did I mention they serve horse meat as well?"
0,Mischa J.,Nam Heong Chicken Rice,"Not a bad place. Authentic Chinese restaurant in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown along Jalan Sultan. For food I had the fook chow soup (fish ball soup) and rice, which were both good. For a drink I had some kind of hot plum juice, but I don't recommend it, it tasted like medicine to me. The bathrooms here were terrible, but please do come here to try the food!"
0,Juan S.,Nam Heong Chicken Rice,"Great chicken. The rice is very tasry, not too oily. The tofu is great. Nice and silky. Fast service."
0,Sara M.,Fresco,"'Fresco Cooks for you', this place is in agreement with Jaya Grocer, so you can literally buy your food, and your raw meat and walk up to these guys and just ask them to cook for you. they say it's discounted 10% but I honestly think it's not any cheaper because if you think about it. it comes back to the same thing, you still had to buy the raw food so even though the price is low it still balances to similar price if you just order the food on the restaurant.

The staff are really cool though, they try to explain how the discount actually works but I am really still not convinced! unless if it's a big family meal then maybe it'll add up to be really chapter, but for or or two people, not so much."
0,Olwen C.,Fresco,"I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and say this is a great concept of having grocery store food cooked for you how you like it.

The how you like it part is what I found they got wrong when I ate here though.  I ordered the lamb burger off their menu and ordered it medium-well. It came out so raw that I couldnt eat it. Anyone else probably wouldn't care so much but any red and blood grosses me out with meat. I would've sent it back to be cooked more, but I had already cut into it and taken a bite, and given the cheap price I paid I decided to just eat the bread and fries and forget about it.

Anyway, a great place, great prices, great concept!"
0,Fauzi A.,Fresco,"This is an excellent steakhouse, with Jaya Grocer next door, you can choose and buy your steak there and they will cook it for you for a small fee. Some tasty side dishes too. High recommended."
0,William D.,Fresco,"Fresco is essentially a full service kitchen attached to my favorite grocery store, Jaya Grocer. It is great because they have a delightful menu but will also cook anything you want to by from the store how ever you like it!  It is very affordable and it is a great way to get a cheap, healthy meal without cooking at home.

The main dishes on their menu are great.  The chicken alfresco is my personal favorite and for RM18.50 you can't beat this choice.  I don't know anywhere else where you can get a full chicken dinner for less than RM20.

Definitely try out their deal where you can buy a steak from the grocery store and then have them cook it to your preferred taste. They will even give you a wine glass and let you drink what ever bottle you buy from the grocery store for free!

The pizza is not great, that is one thing to keep in mind.  I've tried it a couple times and been disappointed. Other than, that this place is so great."
0,Veronica C.,Fresco,"Fresco has a unique concept. Shop in Jaya Grocer & they'll cook the dish for you. I've never done that yet. Instead, I order from their lunch menu. Their chicken is tasty. It comes with two side dishes. Don't allow the size of portion deceive you. It is very feeling for a female. My colleague always order their salad, which is a big portion. Fresco is always crowded during lunch. Plan ahead."
0,Diana C.,Fresco,"I just had the best lunch ever and this restaurant. Located in the Intermark I would notice this place if I had gone there by myself but a friend recommended it so I decided to try.

I ordered the state which was surprisingly cheap (less than 4 ringgit) and it was amazing! Really well cooked and with a side of grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. Service was good and very quick.

The price, as I mentioned, was very reasonable considering the quality of the food and the other options in the area. I definitely recommend lunch at Fresca and, specifically, the steak. Really great Value!"
0,Eunice C.,Restoran Meng Shiang,"My boyfriend's taste will never go wrong! Ever since he introduced me to Meng Shiang, I never looked back. If I wasn't introduced to this restaurant, I will never know that this place has super awesome wantan mee! Truth to be told, this restaurant looks like an ordinary coffee shop where they have a variety of food; therefore, don't be fooled by the outlook of it. This might give you a huge surprise!

Okay, back to the wantan mee. The mee is made from scratch; it is not too rough or too soft. It is just nice. In here, you will be able to enjoy wantan mee (soup or dry) with roasted pork (siu yuk) and Chinese BBQ Pork (char siew). In all honesty, the roasted pork is just alright but I would like to emphasize on their char siew. It it said that they serve the best char siew and I can never deny that statement! The char siew is not overcooked nor it is too hard, it is soft and well-marinated.

In such awesome eatery like this, there are definitely downsides and setbacks pertaining to it. One of it is the parking. Parking is crazy around here! If you're lucky enough to find one empty parking space around this area, you got to park or not it will be difficult for you to get another one! Another setback would be the fact that this restaurant is packed all the time, so remember to go early to ensure that you'll get a good seat and parking (oh yeah, to ensure that these awesome char siew will not run out when you visit)."
0,Diviyah G.,Fatboy's Burger,"Fatboy's is a burger joint that serves gourmet burgers. I'm not really a burger fan so I never really gave this place a try until recently when my friends decided to have dinner here. The restaurant was quite empty when we went at about 8pm on a weekday but I'm not sure how would it be on weekends.

As for their menu, they have many burgers to choose from or you could make your own burger by choosing your buns, meat, vegetable and sauces. I opted for the existing burger in the menu which was the Fat Bastard (RM28.00). The portion size was just nice for me as I was starving, The burger was really delicious as the patty was so thick, juicy and full of flavours. The burger buns were so soft and all the components in the burger complemented each other well. However,I did not like the side of fries because it was a very thick cut and it is not up to my liking. Otherwise, the food was really good and I would go back to try out their other burgers."
0,Sara M.,Fatboy's Burger,"I didn't think the burgers were fat enough though! you know I thought the name would indicate huge burgers but it was not the case! I guess the burgers are on different size standards here, but I really miss big burgers where it's not about adding another layer of meat but it's actually expanding the break and the meat and the veggies!

Let me know if you know a place like that! this place was ok! but when I'm hungry I do appreciate a good piece of burger that's tasty and large enough!"
0,Diana C.,Fatboy's Burger,"I really like this burger place in bangsar. The first time I tried it was actually the first burger I had here Malaysia and I enjoyed it.

Their burgers are nicely made coma but a bit tall for my taste. They have milkshakes that are to die for but they also serve fresh juice looking for a healthier option. They also offer dessert options such as the almond toffee bar and macadamia cookies which are delicious.

The service there is okay,  and the ambience is really cool. They have these murals resembling graffiti that look really cool.  Overall good experience."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,Fatboy's Burger,"I've always had doubts of gourmet burgers after myBurgerLab  but I have a change of opinion.

Was craving for a good greasy, giant, juicy, thick burger after my evening run at the KLCC running track, so my running buddy and I headed over to Avenue K for the well-known Fat Boys!

It might be a little hard to find but you will manage by sniffing around searching for the source of that delightful aroma!

Located at the 3rd Floor of Avenue K, the restaurant maintained the same look and feel of a modern American burger joint.

We were greeted by the store manager, a very friendly Caucasian man that didn't seem to mind our sweaty jogging attire at all. I wish I got his name!

Placed our orders enthusiastically, I had the Fat Basterd RM29.  All burgers are served with a side of fries. As I bit into the succulent, meaty, mouthwatering patty, I was transported to burger heaven where I wasn't allowed in unless I wipe that burger juice off my chin. I was indeed, satisfied.

Burgers are priced ranging from RM 16 - RM29. And I always make my burger with a tall glass of chocolate milkshake (as advised by my dearest friend). This milkshake has a thick consistency resulting in a filled belly just halfway through your drink."
0,Eunice C.,Fatboy's Burger,"Don't you guys think that the name of this burger joint is catchy and easy to remember? Well, at least it is for me. I've been to this burger joint for 3 times now and I'm impressed that out of these 3 times, there were not once that I'm dissatisfied.

As I sworn through the doors of Fatboys, I could smell the patties from the kitchen which was oh-so-good! The unique thing about Fatboys is the names of each burger dish. What entice me the most is ""Fat Basterd""; geez, thanks Fatboys, I feel fat after consuming your burgers (nah, just kidding!). I didn't end up having the ""Fat Basterd"" because it has double beef patties, so I ended up having the Wimpy (pork patty for the win)! Not many burger joints have pork, so I appreciate Fatboys a lot for supplying pork burgers!

I suggest you to not order drinks as they are quite pricey; therefore, I suggest you to spend the money wisely on other places that serve good drinks. The environment is nice but it can be very crowded (depending on the time), but don't fret as their service is swift and friendly. I would recommend this burger joint any day (well surely as I don't mind making my 4th visit here, who's with me?!)"
0,Nicole S.,Fatboy's Burger,"Fatboy's is my go to place when im craving a good juicy burger and a thick creamy milkshake. They have about 10 variations of burgers in the menu, my favorite being the wimpy. And if nothing in the menu tickles your fancy then you can just simply construct your own burger! Fun isn't it?

The have 4 different patties that you can choose from. Chicken, pork, lamb and beef; my favorite being pork. The milkshakes are all super yummy and unique, with add ons like kahlua and baileys!

I personally think they have the best burgers and milkshakes and pricing ain't too bad either. Its about rm40 per person if you order a burger and milkshake each."
0,William D.,Fatboy's Burger,"Fatboy's is a legit burger joint, if you are into burgers.  They offer all kinds of burgers, cooked anyway you like, with any toppings you like.  One huge plus, is that they offer alcohol infused milkshakes.

I have tried a couple of their traditional burgers, and the pork burger.  I was pretty happy on all occasions.  That being said, I have some friends that are crazy about burger quality and they are not happy with Fatboy's.  I just am happy to sit down at this place and leave without having a customer service disaster.  I can't say the service is exceptional.

I think there is a lot of potential in the bar at this place. The menu has got a lot of cocktails that I would like to try. I don't have the liver or the time to dive as far into the menu as I have, but it is enticing."
0,Julian T.,Fatboy's Burger,"One of the gourmet burgers I've tried after myBurgerlab. It wasn't hard getting to know this place as it was then the topic of every burger conversation. The place gives out sort of a american diner vibe, which is I believe the theme of their burgers. They have a few choices of meat, but I personally always go for pork, love a good pork burger. Putting the food aside first, the staff service was very nice. I was greeted and shown to my seat with full hospitality.

Now, one of my favorite burgers in general, is the Elvis, and this place has one of the best Elvis. Imagine your burger filled with peanut butter jelly, with a touch of sliced caramalized bananas. Each burger is served with a side of fries. I've tried other burgers which I don't remember the names, but tastes superb too.

If you're more of an ambitious person, you can make your own custom burger too, from choosing the patty, toppings, and sauce of your choice. Might actually end up with a killer burger."
0,Porsche C.,Gin Ger Thai Cuisine,"Gin Ger Thai is located on the second level of Central Market. Once you walked up the stairs towards the food court you would notice it on your right hand side. They are known for delicious Thai food at reasonable pricing. Everything from their steamed shrimp rolls, fried rice, and even the pad thai is really delicious. They have tons of seating and a welcoming environment.

This place is definitely a must visit when shopping in Central Market."
0,Stephanie S.,Gin Ger Thai Cuisine,Good this food! It's located in central market next to the hawker center. The food here was yummy! We had the spring rolls which were light and crispy and came with a delicious sauce. The pepper beef was excellent as was the green curry with chicken. We also had the pineapple fried rice as well. Everything was cooked well and delicious. Worth a stop!
0,Ajoo J.,Rasa Food Arena,"I finally got to use my Korean after few years of watching Kdramas never thought I will ever use my ""very low"" korean vocabulary in real-life!

A friendly lady came up to me and my company and started greatijg us on Hangul and of course said back "" annyeonghaseyo"". She recommended us all kind of different korean dishes and of course wanted to try the traditional dish that korean eats. So we took the decision and tried Bibimbap for the first time!

The food was very shocking on how it was presented and how hot the bowl was and how crispy the rice became after stiring around the bowl. I totally recommend this dish for people that want to try out this dish, isn't that expensive either."
0,Jon L.,Rasa Food Arena,"Rasa Food Arena is one of the two food courts at Suria KLCC, the shopping mall at the Petronas Towers. It is located at the far end of the 4th floor of the mall. Here you will find a wide selection of food offerings to choose from. Not only will you find Malaysian food here, but also Chinese, Japanese and Western options here as well.

The food court stands seem to all go by the name Gerai followed by a number and the stand's specialty (ex. Gerai 7 Noodles). The food pricing here is quite reasonable, even though it is within a mall. And it is a much nicer setting and dining experience to enjoy hawker type foods that you would find on the street.

If you are looking for an inexpensive meal while shopping at Suria KLCC and/or checking out the Petronas Towers, visit this food court or the Signatures Food Court on the 2nd floor."
0,Sara M.,Rasa Food Arena,"This place has everything you'd desire, from Middle Eastern food to Chinese, Korean and Japanese food. I love the Middle Eastern place! best shawarma with some eastern appetisers! absolutely love it!

Once you get to this floor sometimes you get welcomes from every corner and it can be quite annoying or distracting, so it'll be good for you to decide ahead of getting to the middle of the food court. or at least look decided and walk straight to the middle as if you know where you re going then decide within the 10 seconds :D can be turned to an enjoyable experience after all."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Red Lobster,"Lobster for lunch? Yes - they actually have lobster set lunch here, and while it's not entirely on the cheap side, but I would say that paying less than RM80 for a set lunch with lobster and a beef burger is quite fair. Of course, come with the set would also be a soup and a free-flow soft drink.

What I like about the place is that the quality of lobster wasn't compromised just because that it was served in a set lunch meal. You might have to pay a little bit more here - but lobster has always been something that's known to be pricey - but you know that you are going to get some really fresh and good grilled lobster.

Their menu is really attractive and trust me, I got tempted by a lot of their dishes. But, like I said - their food isn't exactly on the cheap side. It would definitely be a good place to head to when you are ready to splurge. And their standard could be seen by their crowd during lunch time on a weekday. The crowd is not small at all, so if you are coming in as a big group, it'd be better if you call in advance to reserve a table.

Of course, for those who are not looking to get some fancy seafood during lunch time, they do have set lunch that starts from RM19.90 as well, which you could get some pasta dishes as your main dish."
0,Ken B.,Red Lobster,"Outside seating is filthy. It looked good at night for 'mood lighting'. Unfortunately the table staff all sit inside the air conditioned area, so every time you need anything you have to hunt them.
Food was average but when we got back to the hotel found the dirtiness of the table had ruined our clothes.
Really bad by any standards"
0,Humzah J.,Red Lobster,"You know those fish and chips you used to be served in middle school lunch, which you knew were just sitting around frozen for weeks then microwaved and served to you, yeah? Well you'll miss those after indulging in this mess. I thought the quality of Red Lobster in America went down, but compared to the ones in Malaysia they are heavenly. Prices are high, service sucks and the food is a joke. Save the cash and eat your pet cat's tuna from a can, it'll be tastier."
0,Sara M.,Red Lobster,"Seafood like you have never tried it before, the food is just mouth waveringly good! you can taste the salt, the pepper and all the different sauce where the lobster has been dipped, spice it up with a green salad and that will make the best food you have ever eaten.

In fact, the best meal I have ever had in my life! was red lobster! perhaps where I was also played a role in that! I was on Point de nit Island in Libreville, Gabon, this restaurant was over the water on wood, and you can sea the beautiful blue waters use the sun and the white sand surround the area, that meal I had was the most expensive I ever paid for a plate, I believe it was 200rm and it was just beautiful. Red Lobster reminded me of that day because that's how good their lobster is! you cannot live your life without trying this meal! they have family set, set for 3 or 4 people and even less."
0,Marija S.,Red Lobster,"This is a place where you go to celebrate something in style!!

This American restaurant definitely impressed me! I was so shocked with how many amazing options they offer. Seriously once I opened my menu I wanted to order everything, but then I saw the prices and decided that maybe I should put some limits hehe!

The quality and preparation of good is WOW!
It doesn't onto taste fantastic but also the way they decorate it is amazing !!:)

I recommend it for sure - you just taste their lobsters!!"
0,Anna A.,Red Lobster,"This American chain recently opened in Malaysia and the branch in Quill City Mall, Kuala Lumpur is pretty new. I went with my family for an early dinner on a Sunday and the place was empty. Servers were friendly and efficient. We were quickly seated and attended to. There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.

Unlike some restaurants where the servers don't seem to know much about the food or menu, this place was refreshing in that the couple of waiters who served us seemed to know their stuff. So that made ordering a cinch. You get complimentary Cheddar Bay biscuits while waiting for your food. These are served warm so that was nice but we found the biscuits slightly underdone.

The mozarella sticks were tasty and cheesy but you definitely need to share a plate as after eating three you kinda feel all 'cheesed out'. The butterflied shrimp were delicious and fresh. Drinks are on the pricey side with bottomless beverages at just under RM10 each. Kids eat free all day too if someone orders an adult entree so parents rejoice. They also have a set menu which we didn't try that day but for RM39.90 you can get a soup, an choice of entree (from the set menu) and a dessert which seems like a pretty good deal."
0,Lucie B.,Red Lobster,"I recently went to Red Lobster with my partner. I have to say all the food was pretty average if you consider the prices but the lobster actually was really good! So if I ever did go there again I would definitely splurge and get the lobster despite the price since they do a good job cooking it.

The one thing that annoyed me was the staff, they were just constantly hovering and disrupting our conversation by replacing our water and napkins every 5 minutes - it was very unnecessary and annoying."
0,Alexandra M.,Red Lobster,"I went to a Reb Lobster in Canada once and I must admit it was pretty delicious. So I couldn't wait to try the one here.

This is definitely a bit more expensive place but it is worth it. And in fact they even offer some specials at times which can range between RM40 and RM90. One of those sets it includes the soup of the day, one main (butterfly fried shrimp for me) and a desert. You can choose a second options which has lobster in a few different options but you need to double the cost of the first set.

Another neat thing is that if you go out with the family and purchase a dish for yourself then kids eat free."
0,Dean N.,Marini's on 57,"If you visit Kuala Lumpur, it is a must to visit Marini's on 57.  Marini's on 57n is located next to the the Petronas Towers.  It is in a smaller building next to the twin towers, but I believe it is still one complex.  You will take multiple elevators to reach the 57th floor.  So exclusive.  

Once you reach the top, the view at Marini's is stunning.  You will be able to see the skyline of Kuala Lumpur.  There is a rooftop bar area and the dinning area.  You can reserve a table for both the restaurant and rooftop bar in advance.  Note that there will be a minimum spend per person.  It honestly is not that much when you consider what you will be ordering for food and drinks.  The dining area is Italian and the food and service here is excellent.  When I dined here, I ordered the 5 piece prix fix menu which offered a sample the chef's delights.  The potions were small, but they were very savory.  The desert here is really good.

I do have to commend the service here.  My waiter who was the house sommelier was able to pair my drinks with each of my dishes.  So, that would be four drinks.  Ha!   He and his staff were focused on providing the best customer service for an enhanced dining experience.  At the end of dinner, he brought out gifts knowing that I would be traveling the next day.  That was so thoughtful.  

Food and Drink = Excellent
Service = Outstanding
View = Superb
Value = Worth every ringgit"
0,Alejandra A.,Marini's on 57,"This is one of the most, dare I say the most, amazing restaurant that I have ever been to. Me and my boyfriend are in KL on vacation and we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice dinner, and we certainly did! This place is quite pricey for Malaysia, so prepare for that. We are from the U.S. so it is roughly $30-40 per plate depending on what you order. THE VIEW. It is located on floor 57 and takes 3 different elevators plus a security check point to get to. It is in one of the highest towers in the city and overlooks all of Kuala Lumpur, absolutely gorgeous!

What stood out to me the most was the customer service, it was almost as good as the food if you can believe that! Out main waiter so so friendly and welcoming, he really made us feel comfortable in the environment with his sense of humor and explanations of everything that was brought out. He even came over towards the end of our dinner to chat and get to know us a bit better which I thought was very nice! There were multiple waiters serving and taking away our dishes/glasses, all very nice and respectful.

They serve you bread when you are seated. We did not order an appetizer because we were afraid that we would be too full, and that was the right call! The portions here are not very big overall but they have a lot of small dishes they bring out for you to try. First, they brought out this beautiful tree with two round food objects hanging from it, this was the ""appetizer"" before our food came out. One was red and one was green, with a powder coating the outside. The red one tasted a bit spicey and citrusy while the green one tasted more mellow with great flavor, containing some sort of veggie. They were crunchy and delicious, a great way to start the meal.

I ordered the raviolo di bagoss e tartufo and my boyfriend got the tangliolini al tartufo. The ravioli was a very small portion, so beware of that. It was served in theee small holes on the dish with two raviolis in each hole, along with aged Parmesan shavings and a cheese foam in each hole with a hint of truffle. To be fair, the waiter did warm me of the portion size but I did not mind. The ravioli was cooked al dente which I loved, and the taste was impeccable! It tasted very cheesy of aged Parmesan and you could taste the hint of truffle that was not too overpowering, I absolutely loved it. The tangliolini was my favorite dish though! The portion was bigger, although it did cost a bit more, and the flavor was so bold. The pasta was slightly thick and the sauce was very creamy. The dish tasted mainly of truffle which was amazing, it even had large truffle shavings topping the whole dish which you can really taste when taking your first bite. The spaghetti was cooked slightly over al dente but made for a great dish. The waiter asked about any food allergies at the beginning of your meal so be sure to specify any concerns at that point.

While waiting on dessert, the waiter brought out a ""pre-dessert"" dish which I thought was a great simple but charming touch on the restaurants part. It was egg yolk mixed with rum and a chocolate coating, he even told us a back story of how this dessert came to be many years ago when sailers were trying to conserve imported rum. Very delicious but very hot so watch out when taking your first bite! Our dessert presentation what just as amazing as the dessert itself! We ordered the marinis sfera, basically a chocolate sphere with raspberries and a caramel mousse filling. This is what you have seen in those videos online where they pour warm chocolate into a chocolate sphere and it melts all 7 layers until it reaches the mousse center! It is a gorgeous presentation because they add dry ice to the sizes so it looks steamy, and the center has chocolate mousse along with some crispy cracker bits that give it a crunch. I would recommend this of all the desserts on the menu!

As if the hospitality wasn't enough, the waiter brought out a glass dish with rose petals and a candle at the end wishing us a safe flight, remembering the conversation we had previously had with him. Along with this, be brought out a big black box that had an assortment of chocolate in it and we were free to choose whichever one we liked! I chose two and my boyfriend chose three: white chocolate with coconut, matcha green tea, hazelnut, salted caramel, chocolate nut crunch. Lastly, on our way out the door they gave us each a complementary cookie to eat for breakfast tomorrow morning. By the way, all of the ""extra"" stuff they brought out what's complementary and we were not charged for any of it by the restaurant. This was truly a great experience!"
0,Jay B.,Marini's on 57,"We didn't have dinner here since we just ate at Nobu downstairs.  However the drinks, views, and atmosphere are an essential checkmark if you're spending time in KL.  Don't miss it!"
0,Michael C.,Marini's on 57,"A rooftop bar with two outside patios....hmmmm. I liked the vibe and how the girls here dance their hearts out to even the most monotonous music. The drinks were good (but pricey). The music was not so good and too many people were smoking INSIDE!! WTH? That is my single biggest complaint about this place. The ambiance and the set up were fantastic. The view from the place at night was magnificent. You can see the Petronas towers in all their glory ...until midnight when they turn the lights off. We went here with a chef friend and were able to talk without yelling over music and it was all in all a good time. There is a series of elevators you need to take to get to this place and it had me wondering how people found out about this place. What I loved is that there was no cover and there was no pressure to buy drinks while we were here.

Not so humbly submitted,
King Michael C"
0,Clarence J.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's is a very pretty place, with several sections -- restaurant, bar, and lounge -- that all offer excellent views over the city.  The Petronas Towers are right out the windows of the bar area; the restaurant area has an excellent view of Menara KL; and the lounge, which is kept dark and intimate, has a more open city view.  There's also an outdoor section on a corner of the building connecting the bar and restaurant sections.

Marini's has several creative cocktails, which I think ranged from RM35-60 or so.  The food -- at least in the bar area -- is alright, but I wasn't thoroughly sold, particularly for the price.  The staff is friendly, although not always as efficient as you'd expect at a nice, pricey restaurant.  Also, be aware of all parts of the dress code -- no open-toed shoes or shorts for men, no hats for anyone, no umbrellas -- as they are very strict within the areas of the building they control.  [The restaurant sections themselves, but also the hallways and elevators to get to the various sections.]  

""Tiki Thirstdays"" was a specific Fail to me.  I've been to Marini's twice, once for drinks and the other specifically to enjoy ""The only place in Kuala Lumpur to get your Tiki and Luau fix"" (to quote their own advertising...which I don't think is quite accurate); however, during that latter visit, there was no sign of anything relating to a tiki bar atmosphere when I was there -- no related music, decor, food or drinks specials, etc.  I also felt _very_ out of place as the only person in the room wearing a Polynesian-style shirt, among the sharply dressed staff and a full house of customers mostly in business clothes or club clothes.  I was very disappointed."
0,Sophie K.,Marini's on 57,"What an incredible view of the Petronas Towers you get from this pumping cocktail bar. I do love a good bar with a view (or maybe a bar with a good view?).

Don't be surprised if you have to walk a half marathon to get there however. The way will take you through the maze of corridors and elevators (some will only take you up for high, then you walk miles across the building for a further elevator to take you all the way to the top?)

Anyways. This place is buzzing. There was six of us in total, and we actually managed to get a table - unfortunately in the middle of the room, but thank goodness for ceiling to floor windows which mean you will still have a great view of KL and the Towers - we also hadn't booked in advance.

We eventually decided on the cocktails, and they are not the best I've ever had. There was one cocktail had by a few people which tasted rotten (to me anyways) but came served with a carrot on a stick. I managed to claim said carrots because I am a sucker for carrots (the reason why I loved the Ruin Bars in Budapest - they walk around with buckets of carrots, anyways, I'm getting sidetracked).

Now, the view is AMAZING, there's an outside section with an even better view where you can smoke hooka (sisha) too, the cocktails are okay, but the waiting staff is rather unfriendly and you better order a number of drinks at once because you will be waiting for a long time. One member of our gang waited for at least 45 minutes and the staff didn't even apologise OR remove it from the bill - which personally I think is the least they should've done. But hey.

It is a great view, but I would recommend people to dress nicely for this place, and be happy to wait for a while."
0,Miriam W.,Marini's on 57,"My visit to Marini's took me straight back to high school in the '90s. They played the jams that were certainly spinning at my prom from TLC, Brandy and Monica to K-Ci & JoJo and Boyz II Men.

Beyond the trip down memory lane via the music, Marini's afforded me some spectacular views of the Petronas Towers from its 57th floor perch. I also received a free shot. They appear only to give these out to women, much to the dismay of my male drinking companion. The drinks were on the too sweet side for me.

If you want to play tourist and take in the view accompanied by some overpriced cocktails, Marini's on 57 will deliver. But you're more likely to find me at a mamak closer to the ground chomping on roti canai and drinking copious amounts of fresh watermelon juice."
0,Nicole S.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's on 57 is a bar cum restaurant, but I've only had drinks here so far. The ambiance is amazing with a beautiful view of the KL skyline. From my experience, this place serves the best mojitos. Service here is good and its always packed regardless of the day. Reservations must always be made if you wanna secure a table here, keep in mind that many people that com ehere wanna have a couple of drinks and chill, soits not a smart idea to arrive and wait for a table. There is also a private room for special occasions, if you meet their minimum order requirement then you can book this private room for free.

The seating arrangement is really nice too because all the tables are along the full length glass windows and no matter where you sit you'll have an amazing view. There is also an open air area on the sides, nice for a starry night or for smokers. One mojito costs about rm30 which is quite pricey but it has a generous amount of all the ingredients necessary to make a delicious mojito."
0,Veronica C.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's on 57 definitely has the best view of the Petronas Twin Towers. Hey, it is just next to it. However, do expect to pay through your nose should you decide to dine in its restaurant (MYR1k & above per pax). My acquaintance's Italian hubby is the master chef of Marini's.

Frankly, when I compared the price we paid for the taste, I would say I am not really impressed with food alone. But it would make a great venue to propose to your special someone.

If you are there for the view, I would recommend you head to the bar & order a bottle of wine to enjoy at the open air balcony instead. Remember to dress well. This is a high class restaurant & bar."
0,Simina I.,Marini's on 57,"If you want the best seat from the city, for a full view of the Petronas tower, then you have to go to Marini's 57.

I've been here for dinner on a Saturday Night. We had to order bar food, because the restaurant was reserved. So we had pasta and pizza. I was very disappointed with the size of the plate, because the prices are quite high. The pastas were very good. Unfortunately I can't say the same thing about the pizza which was very dried.

The place has a big variety of drinks for a hight price.
The music is nice and it's a lounge where you can have a nice date or night with your friends. The only downside regarding the music is the fact that it's to loud, which makes it very hard to make a nice conversation with your friends. In specially if you go in weekend.

The staff is great and very qualified, making some great drinks.

Overview: if you want to have a full view on the towers, I recommend you to seat outside, on the left side."
0,Jessica H.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's on 57 is a nice way to spend an evening in KL, especially if you are a tourist (like me) who wants a nice and high-up view of both the city and Petronas Towers. We had our hotel reserve us a table-- earliest reservation we could get was 9:30 PM. When we arrived, we had to go on about 3 elevators to reach Marini's (felt like I was going to a CIA complex or something). We got there about 5 minutes before 9:30, but had to wait until almost 10 PM for a table! It was pretty annoying as Marini's prides themselves on a high class restaurant, but we did realize the reasoning for us being seated so much later was so we could have a window table. So it all worked out in the end. We sat and drank wine while waiting (I had the house red-- nice flavor).

Anyways, for an appetizer, we split the scallop (literally, one scallop), which was tasty and presented nicely (in the shell, on a block of salt). Quite expensive for one scallop, but that is the price you pay at destinations like Marini's. In between the appetizer and main course, we were presented with a surprise bonsai tree that contained something for us to eat.. I will let you get surprised for yourself.

For my main, I had the linguine with seafood.. It was also presented wonderfully (again, won't tell you the secret presentation style ;) ). It was delicious as well, and a perfect portion size. I do pride restaurants that get crafty with presentation style-- it always makes for a more memorable meal in my book.

It was my mother's birthday, so I requested a little birthday dessert. Prior to her birthday dessert, we received a giant puff of cotton candy to dine on. Each table received this and it brought me back to a night long ago at the Four Seasons restaurant in NYC, where they serve a puff of cotton candy to you (this was back in 2005-- I am sure they still do something like this). For her birthday dessert, she received many chocolates and a ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate syrup.

We checked out the outdoor bar afterwards, but did not stay, as the haze was quite bad.

All in all, Marini's gets 4 stars because our wait was very long although we had a reservation and prices were quite expensive for the small portions... But I would definitely recommend going if you are in KL on business or as a tourist.. Or if you are celebrating a special occasion! The view is impeccable."
0,Marija S.,Marini's on 57,"One of the most outstanding skybars in Kuala Lumpur! The view is tremendous you can see Twin towers right in front of you! The place is very elegant and sexy. There are red carpets all over the lounge and the restaurant. They have inside and outside area's so you have an option to go inside to hide from the rain.

I prefer Marini's to Skybar, because the crowd is less touristy and the place itself is more classy. Moreover their service is brilliant. At each corner of the building they greet  and lead you towards the entry.

It is as expensive as any high standard restaurant in Kuala Lumpur, so why not to have your martini with the view? :)"
0,Jren K.,Marini's on 57,"Fine dining restaurant with a nice view of the twin towers. I like the food here, Fancy but to expensive for my taste. I guess you are paying for the view more than anything else. I suggest if you are just looking for the view, Just head straight to the bar.. Cost you less."
0,William D.,Marini's on 57,"Very few of these super high-end of rooftop bars live up to the expectations you have when you first hear about them and see photos.  Marini's really does live up to your expectations.  

To start, it is the highest bar in KL.  The view is awesome from up there.  It is right next to the Petronas Towers and their glow lights the bar right outside the windows.  It really adds a lot to the ambulance being up with there with those towers.  It gets everyone in the mood to party

This is a great place to take a friend that is in town and wants to see a cool spot and KL.  It can get pretty loud in here on busy nights, but there's always the outside seating where it's a little bit less loud if you wanna have a conversation.

Drinks are not cheap but they are good. The beers are small but the cocktails are made very elegantly.  This may not be a place you can go all the time but it's definitely worth it every once in a while."
0,Vivian Y.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's has a fantastic view of the twin towers. With the perfect shot, it makes the city of Kuala Lumpur look absolutely magical. Marini's is also a crazy expensive place for drinks. It's a pretty classy place with a dress code. No shorts and slippers that's for sure. I tried a couple of martinis when I was there. The VIP treatment is insane when it comes to this place. You get very fancy shmancy people going to the place.

Some of my friends love the place and would go there every weekend because they loved the view and vibe so much. The music gets you pretty pumped up for a club if that's where you're going after. Definitely one of those pre drinking places to check out!"
0,Diana C.,Marini's on 57,"This is one of the best bars in town to get a view of the towers. Marini's is a restaurant and lounge, which has great music.

The service is great, really nice and helpful staff, and the place is simply gorgeous. You can choose to seat inside or outside. I advise you to seat outside on the left, for the remarkable view. The drinks are expensive, but its worth going to visit and enjoy the view once in a while.  

A small inconvenience is the fact that there is no elevator that goes straight to the 57th floor. You have to take three different elevators to get to the top floor which is a bit annoying, but you will be greeted by very nice staff members, and the experience will be nice."
0,Christine S.,Marini's on 57,"I really wanted to like this place, but it really falls short of being an upscale restaurant. The ambiance is definitely 5-Star; the view is amazing. The food was VERY disappointing. We had the truffle ravioli to start-- 5 pieces of ravioli with a hint of truffle that was just ok. The main courses were not good. The beef tenderloin was cooked medium rare, even though we asked for medium. The confit sea bream with caviar cost $60 and tasted very very fishy. We even had to turn on a camera light to check if it was undercooked. The saving grace was the tiramisu, which was good and heavy with the espresso taste I love. The sommelier looked at me cross eyed when I asked him if they had Gewurtzraminer wines from France; he had no idea what I was talking about. Then he recommended ""merlot,"" enunciating the T. Omg. His saving grace was that the bottle of wine that he did recommend from France was decent. They did give their version of free petit fours, which were really petit sixes, so that was nice of them. But it's probably because we spent $400. Also, the lighting is terrible for the photos that you think you're going to get."
0,Melanie C.,Marini's on 57,"Marini's on 57 is sky high dining at its finest.

We finally reached Level 57, the highest floor of Menara 3 Petronas. The doors to the lift opened and we were ushered to our table next to the glass window with views over the city of Kuala Lumpur. It was one of the best views of the city one can get.

The complimentary Amuse Bouche was presented as an ornament, hung on the bonsai tree where kalamata olives were coated with a combination of basil leaves and parmesan cheese.

For the Entree, I had the Tartar D Angus. The Tartar D Angus consists of Hand Cut Raw Angus Beef and Sixteen Condiments. For this dish, the tartare was mixed with the sixteen condiments in front of your eyes by the waitperson. The tartare was very fresh and delicious.

Mum had the Fegato d'Oche which consists of a choice of Pan Fried Goose liver with Port Wine Reduction and Pan-Brioche with Salad. Dad had the Uovo which consists of caviar, 62 degrees duck egg and brioche. It was a great start to the night as my parents gave two thumbs up to their Entrees.

For the mains, I had the Baccala Trio which consists of cod fish cooked in three different ways. The dish was executed perfectly and each of the three dishes presented were delicious and complements each other well. The cod fish was seared perfectly and was fresh in flavour.

Mum had the Cappelluni All Aragosta which is an Angel Hair Pasta with Lobster Tail and Dad had the 200gm Wagyu Beef with Baked Potato. I did not try their dishes but I must admit, both of the mains my parents ordered looks really good!

Before our dessert, we were given a complimentary Cotton Candy and Canele. First reaction of the cotton candy - ""Woah that is HUGE!"". The cotton candy was fluffy and melt in your mouth. I am still surprised that the three of us could actually finish the whole cotton candy! The Canele was also very lovely with its caramelized crust and tender custard in the middle.

Not long after, the Artistique Dessert arrived. The Pastry Chef of Marini's came to our table and created the edible artwork personally, going through each step and telling you what ingredients he is using to create the dessert. Looking at how the chef create the Artistique dessert was an amazing experience. With a splash of colours, a sprinkle of nuts and berries and everything nice, it was a piece of art. There may be many elements but this colourful dessert has the ""WOW"" factor in it. And yes, everything presented is edible. Amazing.

Before we left Marini's, we were presented with a gift to take home to remind us of our dining experience at Marini's. There were mini croissants in the little paper bag we were given and they were so oh so good! Everything at Marini's on 57 was exceptional from the start to the finish. The food was presented beautifully with unique ingredients and the service was also very efficient, attentive and friendly.

After reading this post, some of you may question ""Where are the prices?"" or ""I thought Mel would usually put the prices next to the dish"". If you are curious, head onto the Marini's on 57 website and see it for yourself. No matter how much it costs, what you pay is truly worth it whether it is the service, food, drinks and atmosphere. I guarantee you that it is a foodie's ritual to dine at Marini's on 57."
0,Kim A.,Marini's on 57,Nice view but thought it was too pretentious for us. We enjoyed the Ambience and friendliness at the sky bar at traders hotel much more. Traders also has the best view of the towers.

Dim sum time it is !!:)

I never come to this mall and I asked my friend for recommendations - what's the best place to have some awesome food - this restaurant was the answer in a matter of a second !

I was very pleased to see really Nicely decorated Chinese restaurant! For once it didn't look cheap but really created a pleasant ambience!:)

Definitely a place worth of visit!!

Their dim sum is fantastic! I think we tried half of the menu and I ended up not knowing what was were- but it was all super good !

10 /10!!:))"
0,Khalisah K.,New Shanghai Legend The Intermark,"After a full morning of meetings, i decided to join mom and a friend for lunch at New Shaghai Legend for some Dim Sum. We are huge fans of Chinese cuisine and always trying out new places for Dim Sum.

It was our first time here and we were impressed. The ambience of the place reminded me of chinese restaurant in Hong Kong cant remember what it was called, but mind you all Chinese restaurants kinda looks like that. You know..with dimmed lighting, chandeliers , big red chairs and the with a soft background music of the Chinese opera.

The three of us ordered about 6 items, which was the Xiao Mai, steamed glutinous rice, deep fried taro dumpling, shrimp dumpling, beancurd sheet roll and the pumpkin dumpling..boy were they yummy. To drink we had the Chinese green tea.

I saw that the restaurant was very busy during this hour, im gathering that it is very popular and i see why it is so. With the restaurant being very busy, their waiters still managed to give us an excellent service and they even came to us a couple of times just to make sure whether everything is alright. Now thats what i call, excellent service.  

When it was time to get the bill, i was a little surprise to see that it only came up to RM 100 for the 3 of us, and we had a lot to eat and the sizes of the Dim Sum were very generous. New Shanghai Legend has now made itself into my list of choices for the next round of Dim Sum session.

Dim Sum lovers, this place is a must try."
0,Sara M.,New Shanghai Legend The Intermark,"If you are looking to take your date to a fancy Chinese restaurant in town, this is the perfect place to visit! the food is miraculous and the service is fantastic! I really enjoyed my time with a Chinese friend I was catching up with there, I met her in Egypt 2 years ago and now I came to live in Malaysia where she lives now too.

The restaurant have this romantic feel into it so It was getting weird a bit with the couple around. but she told me it's also a family dining place and that even her family goes there at times."
0,Adelynn T.,Shawarma Halap,"Shawarma Halap is one of the places which opens to really late/early in the morning. It caters to the drinking crowd and tourists. As the name shows Shawarma, the specialty of the restaurant is Shawarma. Shawarma is a wrap with slices of chicken breasts, tomatoes, pickles and some yogurt dressing in it. This restaurant has 2 outlets. One is placed right at the start of Jalan Berangan. That outlet only sells shawarma. It is always packed with people who are queuing up to take away. Where as the other outlet is catered more to walk-in customers who want to sit and enjoy their food. Of course, take away option is also available. The outlet nearby Changkat bukit bintang is opened from 10am to 5am everyday!

The menu for this outlet in Changkat is more extensive. It has soup, salad, wraps, grilled meat, rice and drinks in the menu. I was here a couple of times to take away the shawarma. *It's really that good!* One of the days, I have decided to be more adventurous and try more of their dishes. Since it was a rainy day, I opt to try their soup, Addas Soup. It is a lentil soup which is served with some crackers (I think it's like a deep fried corn bread or something) and a wedge of lemon. The lemon is to provide another level of flavour in the soup. The soup alone was really delicious. But if you want a little more depth, just squeeze in lemon juice. It was not very salty or pepperish at all. It was sorta like another level of dahl (without the carrots, potatoes and condiments). To me, it felt like comfort food.

I ordered the kebab instead of shawarma. The kebab came with some yogurt dressing, very very thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and a little of parsley. The taste of parsley or onion wasn't very strong. So, I quite enjoyed it as I'm not a big fan of any of the condiments. The taste was just nice and balanced. Not too salty or yogurt-ish or spicy. The thickness of the kebab is just about right for me as I'm not a really big eater.

Don't fret if you're not a meat eater. You can always option for salad or falafel. They also have dips such as hummus (chickpeas dip) and mutabal (eggplant dip) which comes with naan bread. French fries are also available (I wonder why but yeah). As for drinks, they have tea, coffee, soft drinks and juices. I optioned for the arabic tea without milk. It is nothing to shout about though. But it was nice as they served with a sprig of mint leaves. =D

The service is rather quick, depending on what you order. It took about 10 minutes for my food to arrive. First was the tea and the Addas soup. Kebab takes a little longer as they need to grill/roast the meat. If you do not know what to order, just ask the waiters. They will explain it to you. They also have shisha here for those who are into it. Not too sure about shisha though.

The pricing is quite affordable. For example, a small shawarma is only RM5 where the large one is about RM7 or 8 only. The addas soup was RM7, kebab was RM10. So the price is quite cheap and value for money. Do drop by for those who work nearby or party at Changkat on and off ;)

Price rating : 5/5
Nom nom rating : 5/5
Hygiene rating : 5/5  (They clean up rather fast when the customers have left the shop)
Service rating : 5/5 (They pay attention and explain some dishes to me)
Overall rating : 5/5 (YUMS!)"
0,Sara M.,Outback Steakhouse,"Outback is an amazing restaurant, the dishes are ridiculously delicious I went there with a friend as she explained to me that last time she was there she saw some other people eating ribs and then she really liked it, it looked very tasty, so we went there to get the BBQ beef ribs and they were just super delicious and simply out of this world. I absolutely loved it, on the other hand I was looking and some other people were eating, I think it was typhoon, it looked beautifully delicious so I really cannot wait to go back there to try that dish.

The staff are very nice and the prices are quite expensive compared to other restaurants but knowing the quality of the food you are getting, it's worth it."
0,Jennifer H.,Outback Steakhouse,They fail to mention that the drinks have no alcohol. I ordered a margarita. Thought it was weak! The bread served was a hotdog bun.
0,Zul A.,Outback Steakhouse,"Ok place if you are looking for a decent steak. Ambient is not as with the usual Outback restaurants and appears colder and less ""inviting"".

The food however is great. My 8oz sirloin steak was so good I didn't got to take a picture before cleaning the plate. There's a picture of desert however - double thunder chocolate and cheesecake.

Staff us very friendly, helpful and attentive. If you are fed up on dumplings, fried-rice and chicken and are truly looking for a good steak without having to pay an arm and a leg this place is most certainly an option for you in KL."
0,Julian T.,Outback Steakhouse,"Due to my recent craving for a steak, I dragged my family down to NuSentral to try out the Outback Steakhouse outlet here. It isn't hard to find, situated right beside the main entrance, facing Brickfields, it has quite a vibrant feeling during the night. It was very crowded on the Sunday night we visited, from families to lovely couples.

The menu is quite impressive, having a wide range of delicious appetizers, their very own Outback Special Steak, burgers, and your many other choices of protein. Let me start with the appetizer, you must order the Typhoon Bloom. It's basically onion rings stacked high to resemble a hurricane, with their Typhoon Sauce placed in the middle. There's nothing much to say about the taste of onion rings, but you definitely have to admire the handicraft here.

Another special of theirs is the No Rules Pasta and Burger. I think I get the concept of the name, as you're able to choose any toppings or sides that are listed in the menu, kinda giving you no restrictions on what you have to eat. We had both and no doubt, satisfaction. The pasta was creamy and well flavored, I chose to have it with Chicken and Shrimps. The No Rules Burger? I just said every topping you have please. It, was, amazing- period. Three different kind of sauces, melted cheese, loads of different toppings, and a nicely grilled patty.

Now let's get down to business, the steak. I went straight for the Outback Special, which is a Sirloin (6oz or 8oz) marinated with 17 different spices, that's what they told me at least. Nevertheless, it tasted like heaven. You can really feel the power of the grill and how well it's cooked according to your preference. Such taste has only rarely existed on my taste buds. It comes with two sides of your choice as well.

Overall, it's a good place with value for money and excellent service. The staff were all smiles and funny too (insert inside joke). Perfect for an occasion, event, or maybe just to satisfy a steak craving."
0,Onn Rei T.,Outback Steakhouse,"Right, I never thought that I would try the food here at 11.30am for brunch. Yup you heard me right, for brunch. Was meeting a friend of a friend and they suggested this place which i have no idea why.

Anyway, this place is definitely suitable for small groups, groups of 4 or even 8 as it serves good portion and quality food. Noise level is ok, think about the typical restaurant bar kinda place.

Price wise, well..... let's just say my typical breakfast is eggs and toast at any local kopitiam. Though i do appreciate western breakfast but this was a little too fancy for my taste for breakfast. Expect your bills to be about RM30-50 depending if you ordered steaks or burger.

Food presentation was ok, I ordered a sirloin Caesar salad, which was a steak cooked to medium and put on a caeser salad. The experience was mixed. The steak was beautifully cooked, well seasoned, juicy. But serving on a cold, salty kinda wet caeser salad was a little off for me. Can't really put a finger on it but it just wasn't something that i would recommend eating together.

I would love to go back and try the New York Strip (after my pay day hahahaha) kinda broke now to try outback steakhouse.

If you crave american food, please do stop by and try."
0,Cassidy J.,Outback Steakhouse,A taste of America for us in Malaysia! We were craving steak and this sure hit the spot. Meat was cooked well and the veggies and potatoes were great as well
0,Chin H.,Outback Steakhouse,"Had the lunch special - sirloin steak , which was excellent and reasonably priced. Service was prompt despite a moderate lunch crowd. Left the restaurant pleasantly satisfied."
0,Alexis G.,Porridge Stall,"Apart from the normal night crowd, I have nothing to complain about on the stall and so much to praise about! Located just by the main Jalan Ipoh Road, you won't possibly miss the place. Take note that it's right opposite of HSBC Jalan Ipoh and there will be some steam coming from the boiling pot of porridge when you drive pass. Mentioning this gives me the urge to drive over there for supper already.

First let's start with the food. They sell porridge with steamed chicken to match. The porridge is clean and steaming hot when it arrives and you will need to get some salty chopped steam chicken to eat with every bite. The porridge and chicken matches perfectly and you will really need to order the ""yao cha guai"" to match together with it. Heavenly. One downside though, the chicken can be too fat at times, that's rather disappointing to me. If you're in for the taste, this place is recommended."
0,Vanessa O.,Porridge Stall,"One day I came across the crowd and long queue of cars parking along the street of Jalan Ipoh and I wondered why so I went to park my car and decided to go for it. It was actually one of the famous porridge stall. Although it was only 6plus in the evening, the crowd has already gathered there.

I suspect it is a family business where the son cooks, mother takes the takeaway order, and father was trying to help out somehow distributing the porridges to customers. There is also a corner that sells steam chicken.
You are only allowed to sit on the red tables and chairs and if you find yourself on a different colour seat, perhaps you are sitting on other restaurant's table (this is not allowed, unless you are also ordering food from the other restaurant). Don't try to place any orders or change your order with a different person because you will end up being told off, which I find this rather rude although I understand their perspective.

When you place your order, you will have to specifically mention small portion otherwise you will be given a big one. If you need additional order, you can always place it in advance to avoid waiting for too long.

Price for a bowl of porridge is not cheap giving the fact that it is on a road side and it is only street vendors. But if you fancy home cook porridge, you can have a try!"
0,Lisa R.,Flock,"We had a fantastic meal tonight for my mom's birthday! We arrived in KL today from Singapore, and had made reservations at Flock via OpenTable in advance. I searched fine dining in KL on TripAdvisor and sent my mom a list, and she selected Flock. It is billed as Modern Australian cuisine. None of us have been to Australia, though Eric R. has been close-ish in NZ.

The menu had a lot of options, with a big section on the left as appetizers and share-ables, plus some salads, vegetarian dishes, seafood, meats, sides, and desserts. We were fortunate to have Hanif as our server. He was very patient, kind, and informative. I initially ordered the sparkling brut rose but the hotel apparently had sold out - um, oops tomorrow is New Year's Eve so I hope a shipment is coming! I opted for Asahi instead. Eric R. had an Australian beer and my mom had a glass of pinot noir.

We decided to try a bunch of different dishes. We started with the new style scallop sashimi which had yuzu pearls and grated daikon, the wagyu beef hot rock, and the heirloom tomato salad. The chevre came from a locally source cheesemaker called Milky Whey - how clever! There is a farm that the restaurant has north of KL that grows a lot of its herbs and vegetables! The salad had pesto and olive ""licorice"" but it tasted like dehydrated olives. The wagyu was spectacular. The fat made the beef so flavorful that it needed no seasoning or sauce.

Next came the wild mushroom pau, which were steamed buns that were designed to look at like mushroom caps (which is amazing in itself), stuffed with mushrooms. They were very delicious and filling, though listed as an item for ""pecking."" I also ordered the duck foie gras with soft polenta, fig jam, and beet coral. This was also very tasty and savory.

My mom ordered the crispy skin trout for her entree with a side salad instead of the accompanying mussels. Initially it came out rare inside so she sent it back and it came out sizzling hot and cooked through. I tasted it and it was great. We also split the vegetable biryani, which was spiced perfectly and very good. We were so full when this came out! It was served with sambar, daal, and raita.

To end the meal, the staff brought out cake pops and a sparkler to celebrate my mom's birthday. We all sang together and finished the meal with cake pops and hot green tea. I did not know until we were in the elevator that I would get a discount on the meal for being a Marriott Bonvoy member and also earn points for the meal. Overall, it was a fun dining experience, a trendy atmosphere, and we had great service too!"
0,Wen H.,M Terrace Restaurant & Food,"One of the most frequent lunch place to visit because I work around Masjid Jamek, a place that is halal with a lot of different varieties of food. This diner is located at the 2nd floor of Hotel Arenaa Mountbatten Kuala Lumpur.

The most popular dish as voted by us is the Fish and Chips. They are definitely very generous on their fishes and it is served with French fries and coleslaw. Remember to order their signatuere wasabi mayonnaise. Other food that is commonly ordered by us is the Carbonara Spaghetti, and their bento rice where you can try it out.

The best thing in Arenna is that they serve drinks with just an additional RM1, whereby you can opt for lime juice, lavender tea or ice lemon tea.

Overall, Arenna Diner is a very casual place for a quick lunch around the area, but watch out as during lunch time it maybe a little too crowded and u have to wait slightly longer for your food to be served."
0,Kimberly X.,M Terrace Restaurant & Food,"Located on the Mezzanine floor of the Arenaa Star hotel in KL, M Terrace is mostly popular amongst the work crowd. Usually packed during the weekday lunch hour, they have a set lunch for about RM12-RM15. Nothing really to shout about but it is one of the few restaurants in the immediate area serving Western cuisine. It is usually empty save for its lunch hour where its mostly packed with patrons from the surrounding office buildings.

The place is good for a quick lunch break as food is served very fast and there are ample seating places. The food is simple and reasonable, but don't expect any award winning dishes as its your usual Fish and Chips and Chicken Chop variety."
0,Nicole S.,Restoran Sentul Curry House,"I absolutely love Sentul Curry House and its my go to place for my Curry fix! They don't serve banana leaf here, you just eat on a plate. However, the variety of food is amazing. There are close to 50-60 dishes and even 4 types of briyani to choose from, this is good cause everyone in the family can eat what they like. Its self service and food is lined up like at a chinese mix rice shop.

Food is about RM15-20 per person depending on what you take. Of course the seafood like sotong and prawns cost more than the chicken and mutton so if you're thrifty stick to the poultry. Food quality here is good to. Seafood is fresh and everything is cooked to perfection. I crave this place pretty often and I've not been disappointed so far."
0,Nadhira S.,Restoran Sentul Curry House,"If you are on Jalan Ipoh driving down towards Jalan Tun Razak, you won't miss this place because there will be a big signboard on your left that spells out ""Kanna Fish Head Curry House"". It's normally livelier at night because the signage has bright lights.

I have yet to try their main fish head curry but the other day when I ordered Roti Kosong, they served it with their curry and it was amazing. I'm not much of an Indian food fan, I have my moments - but the fish head curry that I had with my Roti Kosong was amazing. Even after my Roti was finished I still ordered for another plate of curry just so I can slurp it before I leave. I loved it. I don't love many curry dishes but I thought this one wasn't bad at all."
0,James L.,Restoran Sentul Curry House,"It was a brilliant Sunday morning after a pre-wedding photoshoot. The bunch of us were hungry and one of us suggested this curry house.

We all jumped into our cars and carpool our way to this restaurant. There's ample parking space outside the restaurant. But we went in the afternoon and it wasn't really jam packed to being with.

The restaurant was formerly a warehouse. It has since undergo renovation and it looks very good with the new plaster ceiling. They lay down their food all on the left side of the restaurant. Everything looks extremely delicious. They have all sorts of chicken curry, lamb curry and varuvel style cooking. They have squid and crabs on top of their famous fish head curry. The fish head curry is easily larger than any average size human head. It cost easily over RM80 for one of it.

We all took whatever we like and started munching. We had lamb and chicken to share on top of what we took. After finishing our meal we all concluded that this is indeed a superb place and we all would return again for it."
0,Kimberly X.,Restoran Sentul Curry House,"One of my favourite go-to places for South Indian food when i'm in the KL area, Sentul Curry House serves up a mean briyani rice set. I'm more of a North Indian food kinda gal, but this place is definitely a winner. Their fried crabs are amazing, and their huge! A must try is their crab cutlet, I've only ever had crab cutlets in the Lotus PJ restaurant so I was pleasantly surprised to find them here as well. Their priced at RM6 per cutlet, a little steep but definitely better than the usual fish cutlets."
0,Joanna N.,Restoran Sentul Curry House,"Sentul Curry House is a nice place to eat at if you're in the mood for South Indian Food. This isn't the usual roti canai, thosai and naan type place. They serve white/briyani rice with an assortment of dishes. They have such a wide spread of food with more than 10 different types of dishes served. For example, mutton curry, chicken curry, crab curry, different types of stir-fried vegetables and various types of meat cooked paratel style. I usually eat any of these things with their rasam because it really just goes with anything. Don't worry about parking because they have their own parking lot near the restaurant."
0,Zatara J.,Thong Lung Sung,"A good spot for crab. There's plenty on the menu, many choices of great seafood. The spicy crab was so good. TLS is one of my top seafood restaurants in Klang Valley. Other than thay, the clam soup is the best I've ever had. I love everything I had here, the clam soup, fried mantis prawn and the crabs were amazing!"
0,Julian T.,Thong Lung Sung,"My dad suggested we have crabs the other night and coincidentally, we saw an ad in a magazine for Thong Lung Sung in Kepong. It wasn't really hard to find, they were very thorough with signage which helped guide us to the restaurant. Parking however, was really hard to get, so we parked further out the road and walked in.

The weekend crowd is obvious, but we were rather lucky to had be able to secure a table in the outdoor section. The waiter quickly attended to us and told us the wait can be long due to the crowd, but there's nothing we won't do for crabs, hue hue hue.

They also have other signature dishes which didn't disappoint us at all. The crabs were served last, so we decided to have rice with dishes. We ordered the signature tofu which consisted of a soft Tofu topped with Minced Meat and surrounded by Fried Tofu served with chilli sauce. It was a delight, proving to be a great appetizer.  We also had the Clams with soup, which I found quite salty to my liking, but nevertheless, appetizing.

When the crabs finally came, we were all too hasty to dig in, I even almost forgot to take a snapshot of it. Now, we had two types of crabs, the Butter sauce and the Kam Heong. The Butter sauce was really disappointing, it was too diluted as if I was having butter soup instead? The fried buns couldn't even go well with it, which is a huge bummer during a crab dinner. Luckily for that night, the Kam Heong (Spicy) Crabs were really good. The flavor really stood out, with the aromatic chillies and the spicy blend of spices.

The crabs they serve here are the little ones, so there'll be a lot of them, but each part doesn't contain a lot of meat, which really isn't my type of a crab dinner. I'd prefered big fat crabs. We did wait quite a long time for the dishes to be served, but the food was only average, some were good, some were not."
0,Rebecca W.,Lafite Restaurant,"I've heard and read many good comments about LaFite in Shangri-la Hotel, and they have been one of the best fine dining in Kuala Lumpur dining scene. In fact, they are being considered the 'grandfather"" of fine dining. The décor were classy and the ambience screamed luxurious. They serve classic French cuisine and interesting collection of wines too.

I'm never really a big fan of bread, but they served super delicious home-baked bread. They were chewy and it gets better with every bite. We were served with our amuse bouche of the night - Asparagus Soup. The soup was creamy and flavourful. The highlight of the night would have to be Joe's appetizer - Cauliflower Cream Soup with Maine Lobster and Egg Surprise. I've had perfectly cooked eggs previously, but the egg surprise was beyond perfect! It was out of this world. The egg white was fluffy and had a soufflé texture; cut the egg into half and you'll see runny yolks oozing out. The creamy yolks added extra flavour and creaminess to the already well-seasoned soup. They will change the menu regularly, but this egg surprise is still on the menu at the moment.

As for the main course, I would have to give my vote to the Roasted Hokkaido Scallops on Potato Galatte with White Wine Sauce, Mussels and Springs Vegetables. The scallops were sweet and fresh. I was never a fan of mussels but I was converted that night - the mussels were cooked perfectly.

Apart from the excellent food, the servers were very professional too. It's natural that we'll expect a certain level of service standard from a fine dining restaurant, but the servers in LaFite were really attentive and beyond my expectations. We had a slight incident during our dinner, and they were quick to react in resolving the incident.

It's definitely not cheap to dine in LaFite, but I felt it was worth every penny spent and no harm doing it once in a blue moon. The dress code would be smart casual and closed toe shoes and long pants for gentlemen. Smoking is not permitted in LaFite."
0,Khalisah K.,Lafite Restaurant,"Came here for a friends birthday party where we had the entire place to ourselves. They served us a 3 course meal and i must say it was the best steak i ever had.

I liked the place very much, the ambience was nice and elegant and the service was fantastic.

With the kind of service and great quality of food, id definitely come back here again And will keep in mind that this would also be a great place to host events."
0,Maggie T.,Acme South,"Loving the food and environment here! Just had the ramen burger and omg I'm soooooo in love with it!

There's also this Cajun Fried Chicken that tasted really great as well!!

If you have the chance to try the desserts you can also try out their brownies :)"
0,Lucie B.,Acme South,"After visiting Acme at Troika a number of times and having it firmly listed as our go-to brunch place, we decided to finally check out Acme South in Bangsar.

The decor is modern and stylish with an industrial feel made homely with comfortable leather seating and soothing greenery.

The menu highlight is definitely the onion fries which are ridiculously good! I would also say that the toasted sandwiches here are delicious and of course the coffee is some of the best around."
0,Diana C.,Acme South,"You will come for the brisket and stay for the amazing ambiance.  Those for me were the highlights of my experiences in this restaurant.

They offer a menu inspired by southern US cuisine. That includes the most amazing beef barbecue I've had here in KL aside from the Brazilian restaurant Samba.  The food is very well-made and having visited the south of the US I found it quite accurate. The portions are big so you will benefit from coming with friends in sharing different dishes between you. The price is proportional can get the bit expensive depending on your choice. Service is good, and they also offer all day happy hour prices which is quite convenient."
0,Evan L.,Acme South,"I always wanted to try the branch in Troika but put it off for the longest time until they set up this branch right in Bangsar Village I. Acme South took over Garibaldi's former lot and shares the same row as The Daily Grind.

I had high expectations for this place when i first heard about it and was sadly left disappointed. For the menu selections, it was rather bland and uninteresting - there was nothing that really stands out. And the prices here, please be warn - they are pretty astronomical. If you think Plan B is expensive, this place is even more pricey with the mediocre dishes..

I ordered the Parmesan Pot Chicken pie, which was so bland, and not worth the RM40, though i have to admit the fries were yummy. Just the fries.  My friend's order Toasted Chicken & Avocado Panini sandwich was pretty decent. But overall, the menu just doesn't excite me.

Essentially, this is the sort of place you are paying for the ambience. It makes for a good cozy hangout. I love the overall vibe of the place - the black brick walls and the juxtaposition of the sexy leather seats. If i were to return, i would be back just for dessert and drinks."
0,Intan N.,Acme South,"Acme South is my fave place for breakfast/brunch/lunch. They serve Southern American style food like gumbo, hush puppies and Jambalaya

I usually order the brisket sandwich which comes with potato wedges. The sauces are interesting a trio of espresso, watermelon and onion vinegar, they just work somehow. I also love their spicy chicken wings.
One tip do not try the chicken waffles because honestly it is t worth it you could seriously make better at home.

They have a very nice concept for interior with dim romantic lighting."
0,Ian L.,Acme South,"It's southern American cuisine that draws our attention to this place. Once you step in, the Southern influence is vivid borders on tackiness.
   Barbecue beef briskets are the show stopper here with a rigid 24-hour cooking method. Other appealing dishes include ribs, po'boy sandwiches and gumbo - all served in true Southern American fashion.
   But the question is, are Malaysian ready for Southern cuisine? The subtlety of the cuisine isn't for anyone. If you're a Tex-Mex lover, best stick to Chili's."
0,Veronica C.,Acme South,"Please do avoid this restaurant. I had a nasty experience of being verbally abused by the Operations Manager of Acme. I voiced my concern of the toilet door not being covered properly (there was a hole in the door). While I was using the toilet cubicle, I heard a male voice and saw hands & a measuring tape through the glass door. Instead of being professional and mature, he invalidated my concern and hurled profanities at me as I caught him in the restroom holding a measuring tape & talking on his phone. When a customer is insulted, it is not surprising to lose customers."
0,James L.,Acme South,"I love the beautiful industrial interior design with the big lights on the ceiling. The entrance to this place has got a large door to give you this grand feeling of entering a poshy place.

The place is brightly lit with natural light during the daytime because of the big panel windows and it gets very dimly lit during the night. A pretty romantic atmosphere I should say.

For the beer lovers, this place offers happy hour all day long. They have plenty of cocktails to choose from and coffee for those who are designated drivers. The food is massive in size and price. The brisket cost RM49 per portion and the ribs is RM89 just to give you a price range. My friends and I tried out their BBQ meats and we all approved of the quality for the price.

Although this is a halal dining outlet, they do have plans to have a branch with all the porkilicous dish. This is a great place to eat and drink if you plan to spend."
0,Bryan S.,Acme South,"Come here specifically for the beef brisket and Bloody Mary. Inspired by the revered BBQ culture of Southern America, Acme South dishes out mouthwatering Texan style staples amidst a surprisingly sophisticated setting.  Creole and Southern staples like seafood jambalaya, blackened chicken and hearty po' boy sandwiches all make an appearance but the standout of this place has to be the 12-hour smoked beef brisket and/or ribs. A carnivore's wet dream, these babies are tender, robustly flavored and generous in terms of portion size. While it was a little on the dry side, I still really enjoyed this dish."
0,Kimberly X.,Acme South,"A spin off from their Acme Bar and Coffee in KL, Acme South has opened in Bangsar Village 1 at the same spot that once used to be Garibaldi and it definitely aims to please. They definitely don't serve your usual Western kind of food as I remember tasting many new dishes such as the Jambalaya which is a kind of rice dish. Their menu comprises of an American Southern styled cuisine. Do try the Hush Puppies which are actually friend cornmeal served with slabs of butter?! Don't even bother coming here if you're on a diet cause you'll be missing out on some amazing food. Price here are a little steep so bear that in mind. However you can rest assured that you're getting some quality grub."

0,YangHwa P.,Din by Din Tai Fung,"My family and love Din Tai Fung. So far we have eaten at DTF in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. When we are in Kuala Lumpur our go to DTF is in the Pavilion Mall. When we found out about Din by DTF we wanted to try this place out of curiosity. Din by DTF is the first non pork DTF; their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) are made from chicken, and lamb (and of course all halal). As any DTF the interior is clean and simple, and of course one can look at the large glass windows to see the soup dumplings being made. We ordered chicken dumplings, sambal chicken dumplings, and some vegetables. I did enjoy the chicken dumplings, but I don't think I quite liked the sambal dumplings. Maybe it's just me, but the flavour was a bit sweet and didn't go well as soup dumplings. It was not bad at all, but was not my favourite flavour. Other than that I really enjoyed other dishes. The service was a little less attentive than the other DTF, but nothing bad. I probably will not go back here because I can easily go to other DTF, but I applaud the non pork option!"
0,Michelle C.,Restaurant Seoul Korea,"There is almost always a line to enter this restaurant and the last time i went, I had to wait almost an hour for a table. Located on the first floor of a corner shoplot, the line can stretch down the stairs onto the ground floor and beyond.

The wait was truly worth it as the Korean food here stands out so significantly in my memory compared to the numerous Korean restaurants I've tried. their banchan (side dishes) included such specialties like Burdock and baby potatoes. Their soups have a deeper and more savoury taste, somehow it has been boiled longer than other places so the flavour of the meat really soaks into the broth.

It speaks volumes that even after so many years I still remember vividly the taste of the dishes I ordered here. The lines understandably reflect the amount of care and thought that goes into their menu plan for each day."
0,Jay O.,Flavor Restaurant,"HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, SWEET JESUS! Thanks for the hooked up, Samantha.

Recently, I went to a food tasting event in Flavor restaurant at Swiss Garden International Hotel. The BEST hotel restaurant that I had in Kuala Lumpur. They are comparable with overseas, No kidding. However, not many people acquired this Hotel. it is actually located at (Jalan Imbi monorial station, 10 minutes walk and they are nearby the roadside) Trust me my friends, It's TOTALLY WORTH the walk. Swiss Garden International Hotel has been over decades and I have to say they have one of the finest chef in town. Once you try it, there's no guarentee of turning back. It's an addiction that could not be cured. Thanks to Samantha, the marketing manager. She hooked me up with the tasting event , It was the highlight of the year. Not to mention her incredible personality which my niece and I love. She is extremely friendly and cheerful.

Anyways, let's review shall we? First of all, they started with the ultimate 'YEE SANG' which is a chinese tradition that I believe is said to be , bringing fortune and good health aspect on the year. One thing I love about their Lou Sang is that they actually put red fresh baby octopus, gummy jelly fish, mouth-watering scallop finger and scrumptious Salmon as one of their topping. It is their Auspicious Swiss-Garden's Yee sang. Yummiest Yee Sang I had in my life. You could either choose half portion ( only at RM 98 ++) or one Big' O portion (only at RM 108++)  But if you don't prefer this perfect combination, Fear not. They have various Yee Sang that blow your mind away. Next, We started off with their massive lamb, which are so delicious and juicy. However, you have to request to heat it up as they become extremely dry and hard once is cold. Followed by their crunchy and crispy fried chicken, piquant relish curry and Pan Fried Red Snapper with Butter sauce which is divine. Furthermore, their braised chicken are extremely tasty and a definite try on their golden glowing pumpkin soup. Yum! Personally, their dessert I wouldn't recommend but there's an exception, the ONLY honeydew milk dessert which only available in no further than FLAVOR RESTAURANT. It is made by the head chef, it has the exquisite texture and really shines majestically at their restaurant. Their taste are exceptionally delectable and inviting. To be honest, I had three bowls of this goodie!!

Then we kick start with our second round, I must say they did a impressive job with their ""Yong Chow Fried Rice"" and delightful tomyam curry chicken. It's totally breathtaking. Not to mention, they spectrum of incredible fresh vegetables that are well-cooked. Their baby octopus is something to die for. Besides, they have one of the fresh and breathtaking seafood.On their ambience though, they have a extremely cozy and sung atmosphere along with modern yet classy decors that makes every food to glow gloriously.

Overall, My niece and I were having an spectacular experience here in Flavor Restaurant at Swiss-Garden International Hotel. Thanks for everything Samantha. :)"
0,Jay O.,Sentul Malay Stall,"Mmmmmm Yummy!!! Do you love local food? If you do let me introduce you to my brand new discovery. Sentul malay stall, they are actually a hawker stall that place in front of 7 eleven in Sentul. It's rather easy to be discovery.

They sell their incorrigible scrumptious nasi lemak , humongous and cheap. I ordered a nasi lemak along with their piquant sweet sauce chicken and toothsome mee hoon noodles. Only RM 6 !!!! Rm 6!!! The white rice are so smooth along with their crispy anchovies. Oh Lord! *muacks* (Mamma Mia)  Moreover, their portion are pretty huge and again I develop a new love. However, you have to wait for quite a bit as everyone would be queuing for their despicable good taste of goodies. if you are terrified it might not be there, fear not. The both malay ladies told me that they open daily.

So what are you still waiting for? Come and grab a bite! Beware though, you might fall in love to it and unable to resist. Haha Enjoy !!!!! :D"
0,Trena M.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"I frequently crave Mexican food, and I think Fresca is one of the better Mexican restaurants in KL. We went for brunch for a friend's birthday, and they had a weird brunch deal where you have to order 2 or 3 entrees and either one comes as a set with only 1 coffee. It doesn't make sense, you can't order one entree, and if you choose to share split with a friend you have to buy a separate coffee. Thankfully, the normal menu was available as well.

I ordered the enchiladas roja which were amazing! Ask for the salsa verde on the side, I usually like my enchiladas mixed. A couple of my friends got burritos and they've definitely started making the portions bigger since I last went there--double actually. In the past they'd give you one small one, now they give 2! This makes me happy because good tex mex food means huge portions."
0,Peter L.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"I was craving some Mexican food while in KL and some colleagues recommended Fresca.  The website and menu looked quite promising; however, my actual experience was leaves much to be desired.  Upon arrival, I was seated outside and viewing the Hugo Boss store (see pic) and when I requested to be seated in a table inside the restaurant, the request was refused even though there were plenty of tables.  Next, my beer took forever to show up, and when I returned from the restaurant, I found my food had arrived.  I asked about my beer, and the server said that he was waiting for me to return from the restroom. OK, so it's ok to leave food out and let it get cold, while the beer which should have been served earlier is held back?  As for the food, it was mixed.  I actually liked the chicken tacos, which were a bit unconventional with the fried shell.  But the flavors were nice and tasty.  The beef tacos however were tough, and one-dimensional as you get beef and bacon bits.  Some cheese or even onions would help a lot.  Overall, I haven't had much of the menu, but there are some service issues.  To be fair, I was able to talk to the manager and he was apologetic.  Hopefully, they can at least work out their service issues and I would a few tweaks to the food as well."
0,C'est La Vie G.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,It's a nice restaurant and the food is yummy and different...I went to the branch in Avenue K - jalan Ampang....ground floor.
0,Lennise N.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Back when I was in Melbourne, I used to visit this tiny Mexican restaurant called Mamasita almost every other week. And upon moving back to KL, I dare say I did fear of not being able to find another Mexican restaurant like Mamasita. That fear disappeared when my friend first brought me to Fresca.

Almost all the food in their menu were spot on! For Jalapeño fans like myself, you must try their jalapeño poppers - it's jalapeño stuffed beef minced that's wrapped around cheesy goodness, in a form of a ball. Their appetiser list consist of a variety of delicious tacos. My favourite is the fish taco with its generous portion and amazing burst of flavour.

We've ordered a seafood quesadilla as our main and were surprised with its tangy burst of flavour infused in a generous mix of fresh prawns, fish, squid and (if I'm not mistaken) crab meat. We washed everything down with a pitcher of Sangria and had a merry time indeed.

Atmosphere was good and kid friendly. Noise level wasn't too loud for couples who are looking to have an intimate experience. Service was exceptional and quick with staff that are very attentive to your needs. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll definitely come back for more!

P.S.: I've heard that their churros are amazing as well. Pity I didn't have any room left to try them out. Oh well, stay tuned for my next updated review then!"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Coming back here for more than 5 times now, one of the great picks if you're craving for mexican foods. They serve interesting brunch sets here where you can pick and mix your own sets. If you're a big eater by all means go and try their sandwich in the brunch menu - pretty big portion, breads are really fresh and full of meat chunks in it.

You can pick juice or coffee with the set and yes, they serve rather good orange juice here,  no nonsense but real freshly squeezed juice.

Do try their fish dishes too. You can expect some kick ass mexican grilled fish here - juicy and moist in the inside with a crisp on the outside. Their fish dishes come with interesting sides too. Apart from that, the ambience is quite comfy and suitable for you to spend time with your friends."
0,Penny W.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"My friend found out this Mexican restaurant at Gardens because I wanted to have Mexican cuisine for my birthday dinner. It is an authentic Mexican restaurant.

We were seated at our reserved table and the waiters are very friendly. The ambience over there is not bad but it is quite dark. Sadly we couldn't take any good photos of the food. I managed to try enchiladas, burritos and burger. All of them taste fantastic! The portion is just nice (I'm quite a big eater for scrumptious food) It was my first time trying out enchiladas and I really love especially when they have a generous amount of cheese on top of the tortilla wrap. Oh so yummy. The beef burger patty is very chewy and tender too. Thinking of it makes me drool.

It is quite pricey but I think it is worth paying for. Besides that, since my friend ordered a slice of cake for me and sang happy birthday song, they gave me a Mexican hat to wear :D It was a very memorable funny moment."
0,Anna A.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Fresca is a nice Mexican restaurant in the Gardens located near Hugo Boss. It has a warm, cozy interior using a lot of brick and the ambience is rather romantic (what with it being somewhat dark) but gives off an overall great atmosphere. I especially love the cool tiled floor. According to manager, the food here is based on authentic Mexican recipes and prepared fresh everyday. Service here is usually quite good but I have been here a couple of times when it seemed a bit off.  

The food is delicious but I find the portions to be rather small for the price. My favourites are the jalapeño poppers, enchilada rojas, and the grilled beef tacos. I was so used to eating tacos in the hard shell that the first time I tasted the beef tacos here in the soft flour tortilla it was amazing how good it tasted. Also, the guacamole served here is some of the best I have ever had. Unlike other places where it can be downright watery, the version made here is chunky and flavourful.

Sometimes when I am craving Mexican food and my husband is working late (he works in Midvalley), I even get him to tapau food for me from Fresca just so I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home."
0,Su Zanne C.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Stepping into Fresca's warm wood and bricks interior was like stepping into a fancy Mexican open restaurant in Mexico.  There were sombreros hanging on the wall. The  minute I sat down, I thought ""this place feels authentic"". Sure enough, Fresca turned out to be one of the rare good Mexican food places in Kuala Lumpur.

The beef fajita was seasoned well. The cheese dip can turn into an addiction: I couldn't stop myself from scooping, I mean dipping, the nachos in it. Then there is the avocado milkshake. I would have ordered a second glass if I wasn't so full from the main course.

Even the desserts turned out to be delicious. I tried the churros with the chocolate dip. It simply melted in my mouth."
0,Stephanie X.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"In a country where you could choose from a dozen different cuisines to feast on, I still find myself seeking out some good ol' mexican cuisine. The problem is, here in Malaysia we have very little authentic mexican restaurants & cafes. If only my hallucinations of mexican food carts along the street were actually a reality!

Well fresca is a new age mexican restaurant serving innovative mexican delights. I came across this place while waiting to catch a movie at gsc signature at the Gardens mall. We were strolling around the mall & noticed this place. Since we had our dinner already, we chose to snack on a few options & have a few drinks.

We had their nachos, classic tacos & jalapeno poppers. Boy oh boy they were yummy!
This bangers went down well with their frozen margaritas. In terms of pricing, they are not as pricey as an equivalent spanish restaurant (i.e. la bodega) and their portions were just nice. The whole wooden rustic settings gave it a fresh yet authentic feel."
0,Jesslyn C.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"I was a big fan of Fresca from the instant I stepped into their restaurant. Warm blend of colors, lots of natural lighting, elegant bar seating. What was not to love? Fresca somehow manages to walk a thin a line between cozy and fancy, which instantly lifted up my spirits.

Strangely even during the lunch hour, there weren't that many people around. I was with a friend, but neither of us were really that hungry anyway, so we just decided to split a couple of side dishes. We had the Jalapeno poppers (RM 17) as well as the calamari (RM 17). The calamari dish was tasty, but what really stood out for us was definitely the poppers. It was basically Jalapeno chilies smothered with bread  crumbs and stuffed with cheese and beef. Absolutely glorious! Their famous churros served with hot chocolate sauce (RM 13) was equally as heavenly.

Fresca managed to deliver a truly authentic Mexican experience for us. Prices there are definitely a little on the higher side, but it was all worth it in the end. If you have the chance to give them a shot, I bet you will be pleasantly surprised!"
0,Semi V.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Had the beef strip taco and chicken mushroom quesadilla. The food does contain authentic ingredients, but does not taste close to what you would get in the U.S. or Mexico. It is also quite pricy with moderate portions."

0,Lucie B.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Fresca is a nice place and the food was better than I expected. It is not very authentic, more tex-mex style but still delicious. I had vegetarian nachos and my boyfriend had beef burritos, which he claimed to be some of the best he'd ever had, we also had a side of Mexican rice which was really yum. Just 4 stars cause it was nothing spectacular, but would definitely eat here again."
0,Brandon J.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"The best refried beans I have had in Asia. Very similar to traditional Mexican refried beans. Guacamole is also great! I highly recommend the carne asada steak platter. If you can't handle heat, ask for it without chills."
0,Amirul R.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"Considerably less chaotic than most Midvalley eateries can be, Fresca benefits from its location in Gardens Mall's back entrance -- by the hotel -- and provides ample space for both the restaurant and bar crowds. The menu offers the standard Mexican options from burritos to tacos of somewhat more exotic fare (try the prawn; it's excellent), and they've even helpfully noted the vegetarian dishes too... not that there are that many. It's way, way, way better than Panchos, its closest competitor in the Midvalley/Gardens area. Watch out though, in the evenings it gets pretty cold!"
0,April T.,Fresca Mexican Kitchen & Bar,"This is a lengthy review but I feel like my story should be told. Was there a couple of weeks ago for dinner with my family. We took my mother there as she lives out of town. I ordered a burrito from the vegetarian menu and my mum ordered a beef burrito. When the first one came, the server said it was beef and then quickly said it was vegetarian. The flag on it said vegetarian. I decided to wait till the rest of my party got  their food, which was a good 15 minutes, before tucking in. I decided to go ahead and start eating but it tasted off, kind of beefy. We called the server and he was still adamant that it was vegetarian and we had to insist that he takes it to the kitchen to confirm. In the mean time, my mother's one arrived and it was labelled with a beef flag. She opened it and of course, it was the vegetarian one. Then the assistant manager brought back my one and was like ""yeah it's beef."" And she walked off. No offer to reheat it or replace it after kitchen staff had proded it. I asked the server to call the assistant manager back because I was not at all impressed with their blatant disregard for mucking around with people's personal preferences. Would they serve pork accidentally to a Muslim and be so indifferent ? I actually had to request for her twice to come to my table. The worst manager I have ever met ! She stood there blaming the kitchen staff and servers for the error and kept interrupting me and avoiding the severity of what she had done. I had to keep telling her that as manager, it is her responsibility and not to blame everyone else. I also had to beg her to apologize to me, which finally she did in a most insincere laughing way. She said that both the burrito meals would be on the restaurant. Which let's face it, was the absolute least she could have done. A couple weeks later and I am still so angry about this! I have been vegetarian for 10 years. Apparently it is only a laughing matter to your staff. Shocking. Why have a vegetarian menu if you don't care one bit  about what you serve us? Beware vegetarians or people who don't eat beef! This restaurant is not vegetarian friendly."
0,Ethan C.,Restoran Selera Ampang,"This is my go-to spot for breakfast; their roti telur is great and only 2.30; I recommend getting it with kari ikan

Their lunch time nasi campur is really good too; once again recommend their kari ikan and their beef rendang"
0,Yusuke M.,Restoran Selera Ampang,"I went for dinner for the first night in Malaysia. I took rice and other meals and they are very tasty, though a little spicy. The price of each meal is very reasonable."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Restoran Sun Kar Hee,"Recently renovating their restaurant, you'd know that their business is really good here. Located in Jalan Manjoi, this restaurant serves a wide range of good Chinese cuisines. Thus, it's a hot pick for a lot of colleagues who are going for lunch or dinners.

As a seafood restaurant, they do serve a wide range of different seafood here. Of course, price range isn't exactly at the low side but for their food quality, I think it's actually quite fair.

For fish, do ask from the staff what's the special of the day/week, it's always good to pick the fresher ones right.

They are also quite good at their chicken dishes and they do have a lot of different flavours for you to choose from.

The environment is quite cozy here, you can sit inside and it won't get too hot even when it's scorching out there.

Overall, good food, fair price - good place for lunch!"
0,Poonanji K.,Gravy Baby,"milkshake was good! same for pie but dont eat the one with fish in it... it wasn't as good as the others. coffee was ok. beer was ok. ambience was great!!!

close proximity to Beach Club, good if you want to do some hoeing before or after meal (i suggest before).

good location, loved judging everyone walking past"
0,Kara N.,Gravy Baby,"Hello KL  coming in hot and hungry from San Francisco. Landed at 5am this morning and was in desperate need of some breakfast after 24 hours of traveling. Thank goodness we stumbled upon this establishment, a couple blocks from the Petronas twin towers in the bustling hotel zone of downtown Kuala Lumpur. They had a wide array of breakfast foods - Australian American - so we got our fix of avo toast with scrambled and poached eggs. Perfectly satisfying after two vegetarians had to deny all our airplane food because they couldn't accommodate veg heads. No fear - our waiter took good care of us. I also recommend the fresh iced teas - we had the mango and it was delish. Although we are only in town for a day, we were happy to fill our bellies before a 12 mile walk around the city. Now onto the Jalon alor hawker markets for dinner!"
0,J B.,Gravy Baby,"Breakfast was well above average.  The restaurant is very clean, lots of options in the menu, taste was very good and portion size was perfect.

Like another reviewer, I was disappointed that the pies and mash aren't available until 11am.  If they were available in the morning and as good as their breakfast items then I would be giving this a 5-star rating.

Only other item that would help would be to serve pork.  There is a full bar with loads of spirits, and chicken sausage just ain't the same as pork sausages, but perhaps some come for the food and ignore the full bar so it's an economic reality.  At any rate the existing food is good."
0,Robin C.,Gravy Baby,"They are famous for awesomely mouthwatering pies, delicious waffles, uniquely concocted cocktails, and a whole wide range of desserts!  This place is just 5 minutes walk from the KLCC, so if you're in Kuala Lumpur, this is a must visit place! Oh, did I mention that this place opens from 7am till 4am! That's such a long hours to chill and relax at this place!"
0,Divine D.,Table 23,"Good staff and food.

Food : was not the salmon I expected. Staff misunderstood or was not clear when I asked for salmon and showed him photo of prior salmon dish they served that I came for. However he changed my mind as explained below and I enjoyed the food and water with lemon that he courteously asked me how many slices -- Which I never or don't ever recall ever being asked that.  And speaking of...

Service: despite the mistake mentioned above, it was only because prior to the order he provided very courteous service from the moment of entering the restaurant to sitting down and acquiring my beverage of distilled water and enjoying the tomato soup and conversation."
0,Adelynn T.,Table 23,"One of the places in changkat area which serves pretty good set lunches. The set lunches are affordable, comes with a drink (lemon tea, herbal tea, water, tea). There are 2 menus for lunch, which are the Asian food menu and the western version.

There are around 5-6 dishes which are available in each of the menu. So, I went with the Asian menu yesterday...and ordered a Cantonese kuey teow. :) comes with fresh prawns, Choy Sam vege and slices of fish cake. Normally, I will not eat the prawns (I'm allergic to not fresh seafood) cause somehow I'm paranoid and worried that I may have an allergy attack. But,in table 23, it's alright. :) I trust their quality of food and service.

It was a little big for me (I'm a small eater). But it's value for the price. It's not very salty (yay for health conscious people!) and just nice. :)

I will prolly drop by again to try out the western set lunches!

Price rating : 4/5 (you're in kl area, portion is alright)
Nom nom rating : 4/5
Service rating : 4/5 (the waiter is quite attentive and well mannered and quick service as well)
Overall experience : 4/5 (Yehhh)

For those who are around during evening for happy hours or drinking, they do have promotions as well. On weekend nights (Friday and Saturday evening/night), they have live band going on and you get to request for the songs as well. If you want to get a bite, nachos is nice for a small bite too. :)"
0,Diana C.,Table 23,"Table 23 is a great alternative around Changkat.

Located in Jalan Mesui, it is surrounded by other bars that happen to be more popular. That, however, doesn't make it less likely for you to have a great time there. I find it to be a lot more pleasant than other bars in the area that are often very crowded and loud during the weekends. They serve really good food (the meatball spaghetti being my favorite) and the drinks are very reasonably priced. They often have really good live music, which tends to attract lots of people.

So, if you intend to pay them a visit, keep in mind if its a live music night you might need a reservation. I really recommend going there! I've been many times and had many pleasant experiences!"
0,Ian L.,Table 23,"This cute little restaurant and bar a Jalan Mesui is an underdog compared to its neighbours. We love it for several reasons. It's charming, unassuming and often not too crowded, even on weekends.
   For a restaurant, 23 scores more than just 23 marks. Offering European and Asian cuisine, some of the standouts include braised beef cheek and pork belly. The food menu is compact but not overpowering.
  When the night falls (or even before), the casual vibe kicks in and you can order a glass of wine and have a relax night out here. They also have live jazz band performances here on certain night, making it  an alternative nightlife spot in the bustling Changkat area."
0,Marija S.,Table 23,"This bar is surrounded by other 20 bars in Chang Kat, however there's something special about this one. The cocktails. They are phenomenal! And you have something to experience there either if you're a man or a women! Wednesdays they have a special ladies night - each girl can order as many supper yummy cocktails as she wants for free from 21pm - 00.

And if you're a man you will find a place crowded of happy women. Therefore it's always a win win situation for anyone!

The crowd is really nice and you have options to sit outside or inside, first floor or second floor. The prices are reasonable, so definitely go and check it out! :)"
0,William D.,Table 23,"Jalan Mesui rapidly become a hip alternative to Chungkat Bukit Bintang.  It is just around the corner and places like Table 23 provide a little more class than the usual debauchery that ensues on Changkat.  

The menu at Table 23 offers pretty much anything you're in the mood for.  There are some great deals to be found with Malaysian dishes as well as the opportunity to spoil yourself with a nice steak.  

My favorite thing on their menu is the Thai beef salad.  The dressing is delicious and it includes a generous portion of beef.  No skimpng there!  

The best thing about Table 23 is the live music.  Never a cover charge and the music really lights the place up.  I've seen all different kinds of music there and it's always a good time."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Table 23,"Visited Table 23 on a Friday night which I found Changkat to be unusually quiet - but Table 23 was still filled with laughters as they have a live band performing there. I have to say, this band is actually good, and they do sing songs in different languages too. One of the Malay songs that night would definitely be my favourite, shame that I didn't know what song it was!

I didn't have any food during my visit, so I'm not in the position to comment about the food. But, the staff here were all quite friendly, suggestive and not pushy.

So I was having some beers for the night, and the waitress suggested if I want to make if a three-pint-set for their happy hours promo. It was great that they weren't pushy into asking you to order more.

The ambience there was very cozy as well as I was sitting at the outdoor area and it was after raining. The breezy cool weather, with the nice live band performance - I would call it an enticing night.

A rather special place where you could go on a date, or a good catch up session with friends!"
0,Bryan S.,Table 23,"I always take pride in discovering great new places independently and without guidance from any third party of the sort, and Table 23 is one of the few. Vibrant, chic and homey are probably what best describes this cozy restaurant situated along the laid back streets of Jalan Mesui. Asian by day and Western cuisine by night, Table 23 drew me in with its charming décor, and occasional performances (always a plus for me) but got me coming back for the food, and usually during the night portions of the day. While I do particularly enjoy the beef cheeks, the steep price of RM80 certainly doesn't make it an everyday indulgence, therefore I would usually go with the Thai Beef Salad. At an affordable Rm19, the salad is loaded with flavor and texture as well as a generous helping of beef slices, the greens are crisp and the beef tender. Can't go wrong. Oh and if you decide pay a visit, pop by during happy hour which is from 12 - 5.30pm"
0,Vanessa O.,Maison Française,"French cuisine is one of my favourites in the list. I was pleasantly surprised that I'd the chance to dine here and it was just lovely!! Lunch took us a good 3 hours and we were filled with free flow of fresh bread and of course free flow of carbonated drinks!! This place is quietly tugged behind Jalan Kia Peng and it is a famous place for expatriates I would say.

We reserved a lovely place by the side of the restaurant that caters around 30 people with long tables. The food was absolute amazing and I heard that it's even better for dinner (If it's accompanied by wine) :)

I had salmon and it is really fresh! The chef came out and checked on his food with the customer and we were extremely glad that he took the initiative to greet us all.
Overall, ambiance was fantastic with delicious food!! Thumbs up and I would highly recommend this place if you have extra bucks to spare. Food can be pricey here as it may go up to RM200 per person (not including wine)."
0,David L.,Maison Française,"Very weird experience. We came in for dinner on a Sunday night and except for a couple, we were the only other customers in the restaurant. The staff/waiter was quite rude at one point he grabbed the menu out of my hands while I was ordering. I also didn't want to drink alcohol, but he asked me 3 times if i wanted something to drink.

As for the food, it was also pretty mixed and underwhelming. Trying for fancy, haute french cuisine with a deconstructed approach, but it was low on flavor and finish. As an example, the seabass was fishy and over-cooked so almost rubbery. We ordered the gourmand tasting menu and the waiter also would bring the food, sometimes only for half the table and not share what the dish was. He'd basically drop if off and leave...very dissatisfied with the service. It's quite pricey and for the food and service it's a big waste."
0,Ash H.,Maison Française,"Maison Francaise (pronounced fohn-say) is a lovely bungalow restaurant tucked away from the  hustle and bustle of the city. Yet, it is located right in the heart of KL near KLCC on Jalan Kia Peng. The restaurant serves fine French cuisine and is a lovely place for a date, or if you're looking to impress a girl. There front part of the bungalow restaurant houses diners, while the rear faces a pool with a KLCC view.

If you're a fan of rich foods, go for the foie gras tower and the herb encrusted lamb. Satisfaction guaranteed. I also remember the ravioli lobster being very very good. For seafood lovers, go for the seabass. For dessert, the coffee mousse cake was quite heavenly.

Prices are slightly on the high side, but you get what you pay for. The outdoor area and the pool is also lovely, making it a great place for private events or parties. Valet parking is available too.

When it comes to comparisons, the first place that comes to mind is La Vie En Rose. I think Maison Francaise edges LVER only slightly."
0,Annabelle Y.,Maison Française,"Ahh, Le Francais, how they love their food and as delicious as it gets, I'm a fan! Now, this classy restaurant is indeed a bungalow in the heart of the city center, boasting a menu that is as glamorous as its decor. If you're looking for affordable French fare, then this will not fit your budget as you must be prepared to splurge for some really inspired plates. Begin your meal with a sea bass carpaccio served with tomato jelly for RM 68. Yes, just remember, you get what you pay for and trust me, worth every penny. If the sky's the limit, try the foie gras, it will be a creamy sensational experience for sure! The meal gravitated towards a dover sole covered with a hazelnut gratin, tender duck confit with fig sauce, cheese plate and for a perfect finish - a chocolate mousse with almond liqueur and an apple tart with a fine crumb served with a refreshing berry sorbet. I got a side of couscous and grilled veggies, thanks to the French chef who cares about this vegetarian's appetite, yums!"
0,I T.,Checkers,"This is one of a kind of restaurant,  if you want something different and a surprisingly tasty food, you must try Checkers! Don't order anything from the menu, make reservation and let the chef cook for you, you'll not regret! Don't forget the dessert, ice cream with rum."
0,Wye Mun K.,Las Vacas,"A great place to go for steaks and burgers. It's all about the steak here at Las Vacas. The price is alright, not toooooo expensive. Food here is good, well seasoned and they will cook your steak properly for you so don't worry on chewing down a dried piece of steak like chewing on rubber.

I love having their Ox Tongue, if you're a fan of it you gotta try it and as well as their Roast Beef. The Roast Beef is only available on Sundays if you're planning to try it. They serve salads as well for those who are not so much of a fan of steaks and ribs.

Parking here is really bad and Las Vacas can be packed at times so you might have to wait for awhile to get a table.

0,Rebecca W.,Las Vacas,"Apart from Jake's Charbroil Grill, Las Vacas has recently made into my ""steak-list"". I like the concept of Las Vacas - from blade to the flame and to your plate. Las Vacas is more of a butchery concept then a proper dining place that you'll go to, so you'll actually get to choose the cut of meat you want. You can choose to cook your meat at home, or choose a cut and let the chef prepare the meal for you.

I did not have to think twice and went straight for my Tenderloin done medium well. The standard cuts are 280gm, though you can actually choose custom cuts from their butchery. My steak was perfectly done - nice hint of dark red in the middle, and the outside was charred nicely. If you are not a steak person, then you should really try their lamb burger - the lamb patty was juicy and gamey. Though Joe thought the burger to be a tad too salty, but it was just fine for me.

The pricing were quite reasonable. My tenderloin was calling for RM23/100gm, and the lamb burger was RM25 (250gm). Giving the quality of food being served at Las Vacas, I would say the money was well spent."
0,Nadhira S.,Las Vacas,"Best steakhouse in town for me! I'm a lover of meat and I've only been here once to know it's the best place to go get super tender tasty steaks!

I've only really tried eating the beef steak, which you have to order in size which is better for tiny people like me! My past time used to be going around town looking for the best steak houses and Las Carretas used to be the best for me in terms of taste but after Las Vacas came along. Say goodbye to Las Carretas!! The one I went to was in Mont Kiara along the same row as Coffee Bean and 1Mont Kiara Mall. In terms of Ambience, it was normal nothing special but the taste is excellent!"
0,Andy L.,Las Vacas,"Las Vacas is perhaps one of the more famous Western restaurants in Mont Kiara, and is the go-to place when you are clueless about as to where to eat during dinner time.

If you love to eat a slab of carpet, that is.

Las Vacas' notion of food is freshness, as you can choose your cut for your steak, and you can have a bang for your buck; the steaks and most of the meat-related dishes are usually cheaper and much more affordable than most restaurants. Freshness may be assured a few years ago, but today, as I cut my slice of rib-eye steak and put it into my mouth, a volatile feeling of repulsion entered my mind. A few seconds later, I spat out the food, and did not touch the plate ever since.

I have eaten in Las Vacas on multiple occasions, and it is usually a hit-or-miss in this particular gem. Sometimes, the perfectly sizzled steak, from the oozy bloody rare to the very hard fully cooked, is a perfect slab of meat, and is well deserved for its praise and acclaim. However, the steak is, and most of the time is, undercooked, overcooked or even put on the plate with little to no seasoning, and not even a rub of salt. Perhaps the chef has priorities on feeding his overconfidence in his cooking skills rather than trusting in the seasoning. Not to say this restaurant is bad though; there are just simply other better choices to eat steaks at other restaurants than this one."
0,Diana C.,Sayang Malaysia,"This is where you go if you want to get some Takeaway home went to the office and feel like having some Malay food.

This is one of the best Malay foods I have tried. Their service is also good and fast, although you might find some problems with the communication in English,  and their prices are quite cheap."
0,Simina I.,Sayang Malaysia,"This is a perfect place to buy some take away food.

It's a small shop, with Malay / Indian food. I could say that this is a small version of a Mamak restaurant. They have different chicken dishes and also salads. The prices are quite small, and the food is good. I'm not a huge fun of the Malay food because it's spicy, but the place is perfect tot but take away food.

Here you will find the same issue with the staff...the fact that they don't speak good english so you can only show them the food...it's very hard to talk with them."
0,Julie Y.,Neo Tamarind,"Neo Tamarind has established itself as a swanky hotspot venue that offers Thai fusion delights perfect for a romantic dinner. Though it is located smack in the city, the chaos fades away as you walk up the steps lit with lanterns and the sound of gushing water from a fountain transports you to a hidden sanctuary. My second trip to Neo proved to be a wise choice as I discover that the restaurant has made a few new changes to its existing menu by incorporating favourites from their special festive menu while retaining their classic dishes.

Our first dish was the pan seared foie gras and caramelised apple. Mixing sweet and savoury is a tricky business but Chef Sombat Kokasemkul believes in eating a balanced meal hence he decided to incorporate apple and mixed berries in the dish. The foie gras was seared well and the soft fatty flesh surprised me as it harmonised with the sweet flavours from the apple. Freshly baked brioche served on the side was perfect to end the dish. The homemade smoked salmon may appear deceivingly common but Chef Sombat took things up a notch as he added a dollop of lobster ice cream on top for a sweet and creamier finish as opposed to a conventional sauce.

Since Neo Tamarind is a pork-free restaurant, the beef rib bak kut teh takes inspiration from the local favourite dish and is an excellent alternative that took me by surprise thanks to the delicious broth that was slow-cooked for eight hours in a steamer with herbs. When the squid ink fettuccini arrived, it piqued my interest as it was served on a bed of Alaskan crab that had been sautéed to bring out its natural sweet juicy flavour. If you want a touch of bold, try it with a spoonful of the salsa on the side. As for dessert, I finished off with a mango and dry banana crumble. The hot and cold dessert pays tribute to the classic Thai dessert with a Japanese twist. The mango slab had been burned to release a fragrant aroma and proved to be refreshing on a hot day."
0,Maya M.,Neo Tamarind,"This restaurant is worth coming to just based o the ambiance & decor alone!

Absolutely one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever dined in. Found this place based off Yelp & it seemed to be connected to another restaurant. The walkway up is lit up by lanterns & there's a cute little bridge you cross to get inside. Once inside, you're greeted by warm fusion colors on the walls & overall dim lighting. You'll notice a few walls (huge walls from ceiling to floor) that are essentially waterfalls! Beautiful tables, bar, open area with comfortable seats & they even have little private sections that I'm sure are available upon request. I went at night so I feel as the ambiance was amplified; I would suggest doing the same.

We ordered a lovely bottle of red wine & I ended up ordering the clams & soup (can't remember which one). The food was pretty tasty but not that memorable; obviously. I thought there would be more Thai food options, but perhaps I'm just not that well versed in Thai food cuisine.

Either way, I suggest this place if you're looking for a beautiful, intimate place to dine with some good scenery for pics!"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Sushi Jiro,"For all sushi-lovers, you might love this place or you might not.

I am a returning customer myself, but that isn't particularly because of my liking towards the place, but because of my friend who likes the place too much. This would be for an obvious reason which is that they serve all their sushi plates at RM3.48 per plate, and this is inclusive of 6% GST. And if you think that this is pretty impressive, be ready for more because once you eat 5 plates or more, all plates of yours will only be charge at RM2.99 per plate.

Okay, being compared to a lot of sushi places and even the sushi corner that you find in any supermarket, this price is actually almost unbeatable. And I must say that some of their sushi are actually not bad. But, again, when you are paying less, sometimes it would mean that the quality isn't that impressive, which actually it's fair - it corresponds.

For example, if you get their sashimi here, which you will get two slices for one plate, you will realize that of course the sashimi slices aren't as thick as some that you'd get in some Japanese restaurants.

However, if you are craving for sushi and want to just grab a quick meal, this is a place to go."
0,Julian T.,Sushi Jiro,"I only stumbled upon this place when I was walking out of the cinema. I usually don't pay any attention to anything after a finished movie, but there was a sign so attractive I couldn't had missed it. RM3 per plate if you eat more than 5 plates? I had to rush home that day, but I immediately came back the next.

I'd lowered my expectations of the quality here because of the awesome deal they're having, but the sushi here proved to be better than I thought. They have quite the variety here, and they're all good tasting. Lets jump straight to the salmon here, I loved the Salmon Mentai because it was really worth it, not a bad taste for the price I'm paying. However, I'm not a huge fan of how they serve the Salmon Belly here, putting it on the belt for hours really destroys it's taste and quality. I would really prefered if they made it to order.

They also have much different toppings than I've seen in other sushi outlets, for example- Mustard Tamago, Black Pepper Salmon, Chilli Salmon. The green tea is prepared on your table, so you can refill them yourself, I always liked this concept because I can mix the hot and cold together. It's all the little things that count really.

All I can say that it's really worth it and if you want to eay your money's worth, this is the place. You won't miss it, it's on the second floor of the south court and a long sushi belt in the middle of can't be missed."
0,Tammy E.,WonderMama,"Look no further than this amazing local flavor restaurant - incorporating mom's old recipes into delicious new concoctions! My friend and I were tired of being on our feet so we wandered into this mall to get some air con and relief from the day. We looked at the menu here and decided to give it a try.

I am so glad we did!! We ordered a feast for a king for about $9 each and left fully satiated and with leftovers! I had a Bandung soda slushy to quench my thirst - they add a little something special to their version of this traditional drink and it tasted like white chocolate - yum! My friend and I shared a fruit/bread salad drizzled with balsamic - interesting and tasty combination! I ordered the soft shell crab and my friend ordered a curry. We shared bites of everything and were not a bit disappointed!

Definitely come here for a meal!! Service was great and food was even better!!"
0,Jon L.,WonderMama,"WonderMama (aka WonderMama X) may be a Malaysian restaurant, but it differentiates itself with its unique take on familiar Malaysian dishes served in a casual, yet modern and hip dining space.

This location on the ground floor level at Avenue K is the second location of this now restaurant chainlet. Avenue K is located in the center of KL making it a bit more convenient to reach compared to the original establishment at Bangsar Village which is more of a suburban area.

The ambiance here is great and I think a big plus as it is appealing to Western tourists who want to try local food, but want to eat it in a more familiar dining setting like this rather than at a street side food stall. I had dinner here one evening on my trip to KL. My meal consisted of an order of chicken satay, nasi lemak ketam and a 3 layer pandan drink which cost under $12 US.

The chicken satay here was different than the version of the same dish that I had in Thailand later in the trip. The ones here are shaped like corn dogs rather than like kabobs as it usually is. I have to say that I really enjoyed the satay here though and the accompanying peanut sauce is terrific.

Nasi lemak is the national dish of Malaysia so I knew that I had to try it in KL. But I decided to order nasi lemak ketam which is special as it contains fried soft shell crab! The crab was tasty as expected. The dish also comes with sambal petai udang which is a sambal dish with beans and some kangkung which is water spinach. It was my first time trying the sambal petai udang and I liked it, though it seemed like this dish and the kangkung were a bit lukewarm by the time it got to being served.

As for the pandan drink, it was an interesting beverage to order since it was multicolored. It has got a sweet taste to it that was pleasant. Though I wouldn't order it again, it was nice to try it out once.

While a casual diner may attribute the popularity of this restaurant to its ambiance, that is only partially true. Yes, you can get the same dishes elsewhere for less. But the food here is good enough to make you warrant paying the higher prices. The prices here are actually pretty reasonable for a mall restaurant. And still less than you would expect to pay for a similar, but likely not as good tasting meal in the US. If you are looking for a nice Malaysian meal but prefer a Westernized dining setting, I would recommend WonderMama."
0,Emily L.,WonderMama,"Where do I even begin, when we first arrived, there were a lot of seats but apparently they were all reserved. So finally after waiting. Good 5 minutes to speak to the hostess she said we have the option to sit at the counter.
After taking a seat we waited a bit until someone noticed us and gave us some Menus. After picking out what we wanted and handing them our selections (you have to write them down yourself) someone came back 5-10 minutes later telling us some of our items are not available (it would have been nice to be told what wasn't available when they first gave us the menu).
We waited a good 25 minutes before finally getting 1 of the entrees but no drinks, then my entree came and still no drinks, then we got 1 of our drinks when we were almost done with the meal...they forgot about mine and we had to remind them.
The food and service was less than par and much better at Madam Kwon's in my opinion. I got the Nasi Lemak the meat was dry and rice was pretty much cold.
All the reviews said it was good and we were really looking forward to it, wish we had a better experience :/"
0,Oflavia V.,WonderMama,"Wondermama for me has a really nice decorated places and it brings that really traditional local places feeling.

I quite like the food as well even though I think it's quite modernised, but still the way they serve it is still pretty appealing. The lemon grass coconut style black shell mussels is a must try. It won't make you feel that full but it's really well done and a must try amongst all wondermana dishes. Try the nasi lemak 2.0, and 3.0 as well. It is pretty good except the fact that the chicken tastes like what you get in either Kentucky Fried Chicken or Mc Donald's. It doesn't feel like authentic ayam goreng that you usually get in regular nasi lemak. If you are a fan of durian, try their dessert WM Durian Crepe with ice cream, it's served in this cute looking wondermama cup.

Price wise it's not that expensive, I think it's pretty decent. Food price starts from Rm 15+ for main dishes. I would definitely recommend wondermama, but this is not something that I would be craving most of the time."
0,Marija S.,WonderMama,"I was wondering around Avenue K and what did i stumble upon? Wonder mama :D

Hehe that was exactly when I knew - i gotta check this place out, it knows what Im doing right here ;D

Oh and it was more than just an experience! It was a true wonderland :))

The food, the ambience and the music just made me feel like Dora the explorer ! :)

They have beautiful interior and the staff is unbelievably friendly.

Now it is one of my fav places to go to for a nice meal.

The beauty of this restaurant is that all the dishes are healthy and will serve everyone who cares about their well being. :)

TRY :  WM's beloved 'salad! nomnom"
0,Fairuz Z.,WonderMama,"A truly Malaysian cafe that offers real taste of Malaysian cooking. Love their nyonya laksa, black spider fried rice, special maggie goreng and nasi lemak. Never disappointing. Great for group lunch or even casual date. I just wish that they also serve other Malaysian dishes such as nasi kerabu, nasi kuning, laksa sarawak and etc. Desserts selection are great too. My foreigner friends love this place too."
0,Eveline L.,WonderMama,"I have heard of Wondermama but never gave it a try because it just does not appeal to me when I look at the restaurant and their menu. It was an unplanned and spontaneous visit when I gave Wondermama a try with my friends and boy I FELL IN LOVE with their food!

Price is quite reasonable and portion is big! There is a wide variety of choices here and I tried the Black Spider Fried Rice. It was fried rice with soft shell crab and tasted really really delicious! The portion was too big that I could not finish the whole bowl although I really wanted to continue eating it.

One thing that sort of disappointed me was their soy milk. But I will just overlook it since the food is so good!"
0,Nilo M.,WonderMama,"Great place for a first time visitor to Kuala Lumpur if you want to try Indonesian food. Price is steep for locals but the food is on par with the price. I ate here before appointment for the Petronas Towers tour. Easily accessible and right across the street, I walked across the main road and to the corner of the mall that's it's located in 10 minutes.

The food is pretty simple to order they have pictures of the food items associated with a number. Since this my first meal I decided to go with their national dish, a side of fried dumplings and a buco drink. All were excellent choices.

The reason for the -1 star was that I went later on to other local Malaysian  restaurants and I realized how expensive that meal was - and the food was just as good. If you need a place to eat before the tour I definitely recommend going here. They do cater to tourists (that's not a bad thing) and the menu is in English."
0,Ai K.,WonderMama,"I really don't like to put negative comments.... But the survice here were so unpleasant.....Maybe I came on the wrong time??
It was my first time here and the clerk just took me to the table and placed the order sheets and never came back for almost 15 mins.... what made it worse was that, no other clerk came for 15 mins, so I kept on using the free wifi here, which was good ;) The wifi is the only thing quite usable. Fast and free! The food.... After waiting , I decided to leave without ordering anything as no one is picking up my order, so no comment on that...."
0,Kris A.,WonderMama,"My Mee Siam is fabulous and ooh, the Cham (milk tea and coffee drink) with coffee jelly will brighten up your day for sure!!"
0,Johnny T.,WonderMama,"Another branch located in Avenue K, great location for people working in Kuala Lumpur. Wondermama's menu are mostly are local kind of food but they take it to the next level in their recipe. Though most of their delicious food is the western kind like their chicken salad that my friend ordered, portion is huge! While my chicken burger is kinda ordinary with chips. But their drinks are in huge cups, it's those big old type of tin cup probably bring for camping. The feel of it makes it like you're eating malaysian food which some of their menu do have, but the food is so delicious it could match with western standards."
0,Natasha J.,WonderMama,Loved the place. Had a reminiscent of olden day food in new styling  with good flavours. Price was reasonable too but they can run out of certain food too fast
0,Jay O.,Restoran Nasi Kandar Berkat Ariffin,"As usual Mamak is something you wouldn't miss, mamak has been always one of the cheapest yet relaxing place to chill but when it comes to this mamak. Unfortunately, I gonna say NO. My friends and I were passing by, starving and wandering for food. Just so happen we encounter this restaurant and thought of giving it try. First and foremost, I do give props to their service, they serve at incredibly lighting speed and provided a diverse menu, which is odd.

Their menu are extremely straightforward, it really does consume your mind on making a decision, we sat there probably five minutes until we actually ordered. Restaurant Nasi Kadar Berkat Ariffin is really something, you could see the load of people dinning in this restaurant which I don't comprehend, Let me break the ice and tell you why? As I mentioned their menu is diverse and great but however, when it comes to flat floured pancake, nothing. They don't serve at night. So I decided to went for their rice and yet I still get the same respond on not having it. Next, I go for their noodle and finally they say yes. Their noodle taste very average like any other mama out there, nothing special.

Don't be deceived by their appearance, it is loaded of people due to situated location in a rather assuredly area and they are the only mama you could find here in front of Metromall. Though , ambience are pretty chilly and all but if I ever have the choice. I WOULD HAVE NEVER brought my friends here again , if I could just turn back time. Definitely not recommended but you could still try your luck."
0,Jean L.,The TEXAS BBQ Publika,"This place so friendly with top quality food , their design bring you in ambiance of American ranch and food smoked brisket , ribs , chicken and lamb are so juicy and tender . Love them ! One of the best smoke bbq I had out of America , amazing to find this place in kL .i will advertise to all my friends"
0,Ronald W.,Hanare Authentic Japanese Cuisine,"Fantastic Sunday brunch buffet. Yummy Australian Wagyu, scallops, and shrimp at teppanyaki. Great salmon and shrimp sashimi. Limited to one order otoro and oyster came quickly. Don't forget the ice cream at the end of the meal."
0,Jeff L.,Hanare Authentic Japanese Cuisine,"The places is so cool and their food is FABULOUS! We stay at doubletree which just located at above of Hanare. We already had our pre-dinner at the executive lounge, so we just ordered salmon sashimi, one tempura don and a tepanyaki chicken.

We didn't expect too much, but we've got so surprised after tasted it, simply salmon sashimi was really fresh and  sooo salmon haha funny but truth! But of course pricey la, I forget exact amount maybe around RM2x for only 3pcs.  

Tempura don's another hidden gem too! The sweet sauce soak into the rice and mix some crispy tempura wow it's just too nice I hate it I hate to recalled my memory at the middle of the night!! Goodnight everybody"
0,Veronica C.,Hanare Authentic Japanese Cuisine,"This is a high end Japanese restaurant and it is more expensive than Kin Mizu, which is located on the first floor of the same mall. Be prepared to fork out a minimum of MYR300 for two persons during dinner.

Their dinner set meals start at a minimum of MYR130++. However, weekdays lunch bento is more affordable. Your lunch would start from MYR48++. If you are a fan of buffet, you may consider their weekend lunch buffet from noon until 2pm, which cost an adult MYR168++.

We ordered the wagyu beef on top of rice in a hot pot (MYR120), a plate of edamame (MYR18) and two glasses of Richland Pinot Grigio (MYR29 per glass). We wanted to order the Odango, Japanese dumpling in sweet sauces. However, they were out of stock. The dinner set us back at almost MYR230.

They have an extensive list of sashimi, including the poisonous puffer fish, which is called Fugu in Japanese. Therefore, you don't have to fly to Japan to taste fugu. You may rest assured that the fugu is prepared by highly skilled Japanese chefs. Hence, allay your fear of being poisoned from eating fugu.

Just a small trivia: Serving fugu liver is prohibited under Japan's food safety law. The toxins in fugu are more deadly than the poison cyanide and can affect a person's central nervous system. There are no known antidotes for these toxins.

So if you are an adventurous person and plan to live and tell your tale of consuming fugu, take a deep breath and head over to Hanare with your family/friends."
0,Sarah P.,Warisan Cafe,"One of the best breakfasts that you could imagine.
The breakfasts here are amazing.
So, so much to choose from.
It's possibly one of the best breakfasts that I have ever had.
Great value!"
0,Oflavia V.,Warisan Cafe,"If you are looking for a traditional cuisine that is pretty affordable, look for Warisan Cafe in Avenue K. I love their selection of food, they have their top recommended dish which is ""nasi kukus ayam goreng berempah"" that consist of rice, friend chicken (you can ask either breast or leg), some spicy gravy, vegetables, and hard boiled egg. I love this dish and it does taste really well. Their chilli is not too spicy so don't be too worry about it. Price is also pretty affordable, for RM12.5 you can get this yummy food home (or even eat in).

They have other menu similar too this one such as: Nasi kukus rending daging (price is RM14.5), Nasi kukus bias, nasi lemak kuku warisan (which comes with either ayam goreng herempah, rendang daging or lamb). They also have lighter stuff like porridge (price is for RM6.9), mer kuah ketam (price is for Rm9.9), roti bon, and so many other stuff.

Traditional dessert is worth to try as well. Their ubi kayu and bubur manis can be quite appetising after heavy meal. Will definitely recommend this place :)"
0,Ian L.,Warisan Cafe,"Serving authentic Malay cuisine, Warisan is a good lunch spot for those who're working KLCC and nearby. Located at Avenue K, this small eatery's signature dish is Nasi Kukus Ayam Berempah - steamed rice with fried chicken and spices. Definitely succulent and fragrant.  
   You can order the rice in nasi kerabu and nasi perang. Alternatively, the roti jala and roti bom are quite good too. It's one of the few places in Avenue K that serves traditional malay food and the price is afforable too."
0,Vanessa O.,Warisan Cafe,"Warisan Café offers extensive buffet line at the Royale Chulan Hotel. It is located at the Ground Floor of the Hotel and this place is popular because of its tasty food. Mind you, this Café's food is really fresh and well deserved for its popular demand. If you crave for Japanese, there is a section for sushi and sashimi (grab it quick as they run out quite fast)! If you prefer Asian, there is a section for Asian food and their curries are quite delicious! My favourite was the dessert area and it's lovely!! From cakes to local soupy desserts :)

I was first invited there by a friend when she had her corporate event there - lucky me! The price there per person was around RM90++ for lunch."
0,Marija S.,Warisan Cafe,"This small stall in Avenue K is really an option for those that are a little hungry and don't have time to stop and sit down to enjoy a nice meal.

It offers a lot of options for a quick bite of Malay food.
Of course it is a place where you can get some rice and Ayam Goreng, which is a signature dish of this place.

One of my favourite Malay drinks is  cham ! Hehe I am not going to describe  you what it is, you must go and check it out  yourself. I'll tell you this much though -- it's good :D

Enjoy your snack!"
0,Jasmine C.,Lau Heong Seafood,"Lau Heong Seafood is an old favourite when I feel like having their scrumptious fried chicken wings. They have some tried and true dishes, such as the chicken wings, pork knuckle, steamed lala, fish head curry, squid on banana leaves etc.

My favourite dishes here would definitely be the nam yue chicken wings and squid (not the prawn combo) on banana leaves with that addictive milky sauce! Despite fish head curry being a staple also, I find their cooking inconsistent as sometimes it tasted quite diluted. Signature tofu is also not bad, along with the pork knuckle.

Unpretentious place that is great for family meals. No worries about the lack of parking as the kitchen staff behind will always be glad to show you to spots they may have blocked for customers."
0,Alfie C.,Lau Heong Seafood,"I don't know much about this place before. The reason I decided to stepped into this premise because I saw too many customers inside. I though that there's must be something good inside.

When I went into the restaurant, I realized that the menu on every table were just the same - fried chicken wing, sotong prawn and curry fish head. So I decided to join the party. I'm glad that I make that order because the chicekn wings were so delicious. Perfectly friend. So does the sotong prawn and curry fish head. The curry is so rich with the fish stock that busting out from the head. Plus, the pricing was not that expensive after all."
0,Nadhira S.,Lau Heong Seafood,"For a crazy seafood fan, chinese Seafood restaurants just does it for me. It's something in the way they cook the meals, very light yet tasty and for most cases, often healthier in the sense that salt and sugar is very mininal in the dishes. I had the steam fish and it was to die for with the baby kailans cooked in oyster sauce and white rice with fermented chillies on the side. That's my favorite combo when it comes to seafood eating but you can pretty much feed me anything in seafood resturants and I'll still love it. If you order a small portioned dish it will cost you on RM17/dish.

Lau Heong Seafood is only 10 minutes walk from the Sentul LRT station and it is definitely a hidden gem, worth the walk, worth the wait.

You can come for lunch and dinner from Monday to Saturday between 11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm, and on Sundays between: 11.30am to 10.30pm. They are also always open on public holidays."
0,Eveline L.,Lau Heong Seafood,"This neighbourhood Chinese restaurant occupies two floors of the shoplot. It is quite popular among folks in Sentul and is usually packed during weekends.

You have to try their signature hotplate seafood! I don't know what kind of sauce they use but it is ABSOLUTELY DIVINE! This is a must for me to order when I come here. I don't think you can find this dish anywhere else. Their nam yu fried chicken is another must try dish. Their curry fish head is also a popular dish which I find it to be so so only.

Do come here if you are around this area for their signature dishes."
0,Ah M.,Lau Heong Seafood,"Squid and shrimp on banana leaves.
Fish head curry.
Fried chicken wings.
Pork knuckle.

Yeah, just order those and you'll be happy. Thank me later."
0,Siz L.,Lau Heong Seafood,Love the signature dish - nam ju (chinese fragmented bean curd) flavour chicken wing! Very popular and best in town! Good for family dinner.
0,Wai Min K.,Lau Heong Seafood,"This restaurant is pretty popular so it's definitely busy on weekends. In spite of that, we always manage to find parking and also, the service here is actually quite fast.
We have been here a few times and what we (my family and I) usually order is the fish curry, 'nam yu' fried chicken, and the seafood hotplate (prawns and squid).

The fish curry here is aromatic and so yummy - it goes so well with the rice! The 'nam yu' fried chicken is crispy, packed with flavors and definitely, a must try! As for the seafood hotplate, I think it's just alright - nothing too fantastic. We have also tried their stingray with szechuan sauce and lala in soup - but thought they were just okay (not my taste, I guess). The pork knuckle is also one of their signature dishes - so might want to try that the next time.

Generally, you will see most tables here having the same dishes. What's great about this place is its fast service and also, everything is pretty much reasonably priced - certainly deserving of four stars.

PS: One of the guys working there (the owner I think) looks like Tan Sri Vincent Tan!"
0,Sue F.,Restaurant Nepal,"I had never eaten Nepalese food before stepping foot into this restaurant. And I must say, the food here really opened my eyes. It's quite unassuming because from the outside, it looks just like any other restaurant, and when I discovered that it was a Nepalese place, I was immediately intrigued.

To be honest, the indoor seating area looks a bit tacky - they have a waterfall and these generic tables and chairs. But they get away with it because it's all about the food here.

The owner of the shop was there when I had lunch and I was lucky that he explained some of the popular Nepalese dishes to me.  I was so tempted by everything that I over-ordered and ended up leaving behind so much food! I love the deep-fried momo which is like a Nepalese dumpling.

The thali lunch set was super delicious too - some of the flavours were really interesting , and it all tasted reasonably healthy. I had the banana pudding and masala tea as dessert - both of which I highly recommend. So next time you're looking for a unique cuisine to try out, this restaurant ticks all the boxes."
0,Andy L.,Restaurant Nepal,"Under the influence of my mother, I was incredibly interested in tasting a genre of food that was out of the spectrum in the local food scene. This opportunity was placed onto me when I visited Hartamas Shopping Centre and saw Restaurant Nepal.

One of the highlights of the restaurants would be the chowmien, which would translate to fried noodles. Using a Chinese-oriented style to fry the noodles, the Burmese-oriented spices were added to give it a Nepalese touch, a soft caress to your mouth. The chowmien was easy to the stomach, and very much suitable for those who were still unsure about the Nepalese based cuisine.

The Chataamari, a pizza-like snack was delicious, and was all-vegetarian, suitable for those who find meat to be unfitting in their diet. The dough was mixed with a variety of vegetables, and the crust was crispy on the outside, thus creating a harmonious veil that covers you with bliss.

I would really recommend this restaurant if you are into an alternative genre of food, and a tasty one at that. No flaws and no cons; just pure pleasure for the eater and happiness when the food is inserted into your mouth."
0,Anna A.,Al Rawsha Restaurant,"The exterior of this restaurant looks like a castle so you may be wondering what kind of cuisine would be served here. Well, its a Lebanese restaurant which serves good food at good prices.

I have come here on numerous occasions with my family and have ordered takeaway too. We always order the Chicken Shawarma which is yummy with the meat crispy on the outside and still juicy on the inside. The spices used to marinate the meat are not overpowering but rather complementary.

Unlike many people who love chicken mandy rice, I actually prefer boneless chicken so I always order Kabsa Rice with Sheesh Tawook (RM25). The portion is quite big and my husband and I will always share this dish. Being Malaysian, I am somewhat used to having a 'gravy' poured over my rice (be it curry or broth) but Lebanese cuisine is somewhat dry. So I do sometimes order one of their less well-known side dishes like Moulokiya Chicken (RM16) which is tasty and has some gravy.

They have a wide selection of drinks including fresh juices starting from RM10. Once we tried to order delivery but after placing an order and waiting half an hour, the restaurant called me back and said they don't have a delivery boy. I found this irritating as they should have told me upfront instead of making me wait for my food which never came. But other than this one incident, I have had only good experiences here and also appreciate the fact that they have clean toilets and a kids playroom."
0,Wai Min K.,Al Rawsha Restaurant,"I have seen this restaurant many times but have never tried it until today. Due to how the restaurant looks from the outside, I always thought it was going to be really expensive but I found out today that it isn't so!

I went with three other friends - we shared a lamb mandy (RM25), grilled lamb shawarma (RM10), an extra plate of Kebsa rice (RM8), a pot of mint tea (RM10), and pistachio ice cream (RM15).

To begin with, the lamb mandy was awesome! My friend told us that the lamb will ""melt in your mouth"" - slightly exaggerated but it truly is so tender! Goes so well with the rice too, which by the way, was equally amazing. For RM25, it was very well worth the money. We finished the rice with remaining extra lamb meat - so we decided to order an extra bowl of a different type of rice (Kebsa) which didn't turn out as good as the first one. We however ended up not having enough lamb meat - so you can assume that the lamb meat was somewhat sufficient for 1.5 plates/bowls of rice.

The grilled shawarma was also so good! The mint tea wasn't anything too spectacular but was a good drink for our meal. We ended by sharing the pistachio ice cream, which is a little expensive but it was something unique and it tasted pretty good.

The restaurant is fairly spacious and they also have a parking lot for customers. We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't so busy and we had fast service - I don't know what it's like on weekends.

Well... I am already looking forward to coming here again!"

0,Syamin I.,Al Rawsha Restaurant,"Al Rawsha restaurant is famous with the lebanese cuisine. The restaurant located at Kampung Pandan Kuala lumpur. it's operate  24/7. Wow if you craving for arab dish you can go here.

As usual, all restaurant nowadays they provide wifi internet. so if you want to do a meeting or do your assignment here is the place. But you know what? suprisingly, they have a delivery service. wowww a middle east cuisine have delivery service but is only available around Kuala Lumpur.

How's the foods taste like? foods is good but they should and recommend us the 'DALCA'  or something that we can eat with. I love to eat their mandhi chicken because it's simple and incredible.

They create the cozy ambiance so that we can relax our mind with their music plays on. They do provide indoor and outdoor sitting. Some of them are friendly and some of them are not."
0,Amirul R.,Al Rawsha Restaurant,"I was once awake at 4.30am and needed to eat -- a friend told me to go to Al-Rawsha. Well, well, well, what a surreal experience. As Lebanese restaurants go, I feel like there are plenty of places that do it better (the menu is wide and varied with different options which yet somehow seem very same-y.)

My lamb mandi tasted funny that night because they didn't have mandi rice and had to substitute it with briyani rice -- not what I wanted, but still edible. To add to the pure bizarreness of this kitschy castle-like exterior, the interior is cavernous and massive, clearly capable of handling hundreds of diners. There's even an upstairs area!"
0,Mimi H.,Al Rawsha Restaurant,"I came here to celebrate the occassion with my co-workers. We came here for dinner which is always full house ,luckly we get our table reserved before came.

This restaurant famous with their middle east menu. I tried Chicken Mandy; the rice is not like typical rice but they used traditional Hadramaut earth baked rice that taste so good plus the chicken cooked and seasoned well. I also tried their chicken kebab wrap. Also worth to try . Overall the food and drink are good and worth the price. There are a lot of menu that i should give a try if i come here again .

The facilities such prayer rooms and toilet also good.

The environment in the restaurant ,i could say just fine . Not so loud and not so quiet. The restaurant has 2 floors . which is large enough to make any occasions here.

But , the only problem to eat here is, the restaurant is too big yet.. the parking is so limited.  Limited parking and hard to find parking outside the restaurant since there are just small road in front of the restaurant."
0,Danicia H.,Mama Kim Sauna Mee,"10/10 will return for more! There were many items that we weren't able to try between our party of two, but the sauna mee and canton fried noodles hit the spot! Mama Kim's Natural Fruit Tea though. DEAR LORD JESUS it's beautiful. Cute tea pot setup with chunks of Apple, mango, orange, grape, and lilikoi (passion fruit)."
0,Eveline L.,Mama Kim Sauna Mee,"Located in between Wisma Hrih Lotus and Chong Hwa school is a Herbaline building where Mama Kim is located. They also have a branch in Kota Kemuning. Serving healthy cuisine and some vegetarian dishes, it is definitely a place for those who are healthy conscious.

I ordered their signature dish, Sauna Mee fish set with pumpkin noodles (ala carte RM15.80). You can also opt for brown rice. When it came, it looked like a steamboat pot with carrots, a corn, fu chok, and some lettuce floating in the soup. Under those veggies are my pumpkin noodles which I really adore. It tasted like steamboat but of course a healthier one. Only complain I have is that the fish slices are just too little. Other than that, I enjoyed my sauna mee.

Don't fancy steamboat with noodles? They also serve baked rice, fried rice, chicken chop, sandwiches and steam rice sets. Quite a variety of drinks are also served here but what stands out to me is the fruit and flower tea (RM10.50)."
0,Tom B.,Mama Kim Sauna Mee,"Nice atmosphere, cool and clean. Cheesy chicken rice was pretty good. Healthy high quality food."
0,Su Zanne C.,Taiwan Noodle House,"Two words: comfort food. If anyone's craving for some noodles and happen to be in Ampang, this would be the place that I would definitely bring them to. There are three dishes that I would usually go for are the beef noodle soup, the dry beef glass noodle, and the spring onion pancake with garlic and soy sauce as a side. All three are equally good, but it was the soup that made me become a regular customer.

The price here is cheap. You can get a bowl of noodle for about RM12 and the portion is big. The spring onion pancake is very simple but it is a must try. Make sure to eat it while it's still hot and crunchy (yep! crunchy at the ends!).

The environment is similar to a Chinese coffee shop you find on the streets. Nothing very special, only the food. I guess when serve good food, sometimes, the decorations don't matter."
0,Khalisah K.,Taiwan Noodle House,"This Taiwan Noodle House has been in Ampang Point for as long as i can remember (which means probably more than 10 years) and believe it or not, only recently that i discovered that the Glass Beef Noodle is to die for!

My cousin called me up one day and asked men whether i wanted to accompany her and my oh-so-adorable niece for lunch at the Taiwan Noodle House. I hesitated at first but my cousin is really good at persuading me. (she bribed me with a cupcake,Haha!)

After being seated, and was really confused on what to order...my cousin had offer to do the ordering. Apparently she comes here very often and is an expert on ordering on  nothing else but the best here. Fifteen minutes later came our glass beef noodles, and boy was i hooked?!!

It was so delicious. And im not so much of a noodle fan. But i do love this one. I came here the very next day to take away some! LOL. It was that good, yes!

I'm not too sure about the other items on the menu but im sure that they're good too. This place is always full of people, weekdays and weekends."
0,Maggie T.,Jom Makan,"Flooded with choices here, you can literally come here for months and have different dishes every day :)

It's  very convenient  and economical to most of the people working in the  office building there. They are located right next to the LRT station, below the office building. They also have a covered shade in case it's  a rainy day and no one will be affected by it.

They serve chinese food and I tried  on their kwong fu chao. It was pretty good. Well you cant compare them to the real ones outside but it's  good enough for a decent lunch during work.

It's  a self service concept where you pay at the counter  and the waiter will deliver your food to you.  

Their seats are aplenty! You will never imagine how big the place is until you head in to check their premise's layout!"
0,Diana C.,Jom Makan,"Jom is, arguably, one of the best places to have lunch around the Bangsar LRT.

Jon is in the second floor of Menara UOA, floor of the LRT entrance, which makes it a bit hidden. The great value they offer comes from the cheap options and the quality of the food.

My personal favorite is the curry chicken value menu, which comes with tea and fruit as dessert. The service is ok, and the ambiance has nothing special to it, but they do offer options of seating inside and out.

I strongly recommend this place if you are around the LRT area and want a nice and cheap meal!"
0,YongJie L.,Jom Makan,"Another place for lunch in Bangsar LRT. Jom's offers a variety of lunch set if you crave for a little diversity in food.

They have claypots, noodles, rice and some snacks food too.
Claypots includes curry chicken, mushroom chicken, rendang and others. All these come with rice and a herbal tea as part of the set.
On top of these, they also have the different types of noodles, mostly Chinese style noodles like Cantonese noodles and others.

Price here starts from RM13.90. Tried their claypot curry chicken the other day, was quite disappointed. The curry is not spicy (maybe on purpose). Claypot is hot, but curry is diluted and doesn't tastes like curry. Chicken was a bit too soft which I think is because it has been cooked for a long time.

Overall did not enjoy the food here, but I might give it another try to try out some other dishes hoping it's better than the curry chicken."
0,Sara M.,Jom Makan,"Just today I went to Jom Makan and had decided to pick the most random dish ever, so I picked Penang Fried Keow Teow, It was super delicious!!! even my colleagues who tried it loved it! I love how there was a line and i was like, Oh my this is going to take forever maybe I should just go somewhere else, but then the orders went up so fast I was really impressed with the woman there!

I waited 4 min before I got my order, which was super fast if you consider other restaurants average time for take away. I absolutely loved it!

The staff speaks NO english whatsoever! it was hilarious that I asked about a drink and she replied with a full paragraph in Malay and I could still understand based on her body language :D

Definitely recommend it!! you can't go by Bangsar and not try this place :)"
0,Lillian W.,Big Baba,"Great ambience and food! Highly recommended! If you like ice kacang, you would not be disappointed."
0,Veronica C.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"This is one of my favourite restaurants. Their wide selection of wine is very good - from affordable to pricey Grade A. Food & dessert are delicious. I love their cheese cakes! Another plus point is Alexis Ampang is one of the few jazz bars offering international level singers & bands every Friday & Saturday nights. Their service is quite good too.

It is usually full house. Therefore, it is wise to book a table for dinner & stay till 10pm for jazz. The management doesn't allow non-diners to sit at the table on performance nights, which I think is fair. If you are there for jazz only, then, you've to sit at the bar.

I highly recommend this place to impress your date or to organize a party (a room with a good view of the stage is available for reservation) or for jazz lovers to chill after a week of hard work."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Alexis, even the name intrigues you to step inside and enjoy the ambience which is per to the fect.
Jazz music with dim lighting complete with tables facing the stage gives you a more intimate dining experience with the live band of the night.
Famous for their cakes, especially the Tiramisu and Pavlova, it's a sin not to try at least either. The Pavlova has the perfect meringue consistency that most bakeries fail to achieve. Chewy in the inside with a brittle crust paired with the right amount of tardiness from the berries gives you an out of the world burst of flavors.
While the Tiramisu with a pump of strawberry sauce (I thought it was chili sauce at first, silly me) has the right balance between nutty, cocoa, and the subtle taste of coffee.
Each cake would set you back about RM16++ but trust me on this, it is worth every single penny spent."
0,Khalisah K.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Their selection of desserts is absolutely yummy! It is my go-to-place for a quick dessert fix and a hot cuppa.

Im however not a fan of their food menu, i can never seem to decide what to eat and the few times that i have i didnt really enjoy the meal i ordered.

They've also a series of entertainment over the weekends, and it is the place to be at if you love jazz. Ive had the pleasure of being entertained by KL's Jazz singers such as Atilia, Melissa Indot, Ida Mariana, Adibah Nor just to name a few.

They've flown in International Jazz acts too such as Barry Cooper (US) , Damon Brown (UK), Hayley Claire (Aus).

So far i've never been disappointed on my jazzy night outings there. Entrance is free for those who dines in with them otherwise there is a cover charge to enter. The fees would be depending on who's playing for the night.

Now you know where to go for your sweet cravings and for some jazz!"
0,Su Zanne C.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"I went to Alexis Ampang for a friend's birthday celebration. We shared three pizzas, some salad, and a duck confit. I love their pizzas, especially their seafood one, I believe it is because they topped their pizzas with good cheese and some herbs. The herbs played a big role in bringing out the flavours.

Then came the duck confit which made us all laugh because we forgot that it came as a whole and not in shreds between the salad, so then, we had a problem sharing it. There were many of us, so we decided to shred it. My friend and I did the honours. We mixed it with the pear and salad, and boy oh boy was duck with pear and cashew nuts and salad good!

For dessert, we decided to get the birthday a slice of tiramisu. I've had the tiramisu before I've always loved it. I personally think Alexis has one of the beat tiramisu in town."
0,Azraai A.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Atilia is a well known jazz songbird in Malaysia and I've had the pleasure of watching her perform live for the first time in my life at Alexis great eastern mall. Her rendition of the Miley Cyrus' wrecking ball was, well, like music to my ears. Alexis Great Eastern Mall is well known for hosting jazz nights where different jazz performers come to perform each week. There is a cover charge of rm25 upon entry.

I arrived there a little late and the place was dimly lit so I was stumbling to find some familiar faces in the darkness. My friends called out to me from their table and I soon made my way there. A great way to spend the night with good company, fantastic music and excellent wine.

I really did feel like a little jazz enthusiast that night, swaying to the music and enjoying my glass of wine. ""So this is what grownups do on the weekends,"" I thought to myself."
0,Nicole S.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"I've been to Alexis, Ampang about 8-9 times in the past few years and its sad to say that the food quality has deteriorated terribly. When i used to frequent Alexis about 4 years ago, i loved it, the food and environment. But for the past 2 years at least, i feel like the food quality has dropped quite significantly. I used to have the lamb which was cooked to perfection, and i loved it. Although i did think it was way overpriced. In recent visits i've had pasta which i thought was yummy but only because it had so much MSG in it! I was so thirsty after and the taste of the MSG just lingered in my mouth. I hated this cause i was paying premier prices for this plate of pasta only to have it be cooked with way too much MSG.

Besides that, their cakes are still some of my favorites especially the blueberry cheese cake (so yummy!). Their milkshakes are very yummy too in my opinion, oh and their pizza's! I love how the crust is so thin and the toppings are fresh and abundant. Alexis is definitely overpriced, but would probably be worth it for a special occasion?"
0,Shearlee L.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"If you are a lover of Jazz, you have to visit this place. Every Friday and Saturday nights, they have special line up of live jazz performances showcased by internationally renowned musicians and also our local stars. Cover charge ranges, of which I have once paid RM15 for a local artist namely Mia Palencia, and RM25 for an international artist.

I really like the cosy, stylish and intimate set up of the place, perfect for a romantic dinner for you and your partner. They have tables right in front of the stage, giving you the most personal view of the performer, and also seats towards the back of the restaurant and also a smoking area outside. Their wood-fired pizzas are not bad, price ranging from above RM30++. I have not dined here because it is slightly pricey, but instead came here for drinks and snacks, simply just to catch the music because tables are only reserved for diners only.

They are always packed for the two times I have visited and you need to make reservations to avoid disappointment and you are given half hour from the given time before your table is given away, should you be late, do inform them beforehand. No slippers and shorts are allowed, so be prepared for a classy evening.

Dim lights, wine serving, and soul-ful music, mmmm... that's what I'd call a sexy evening."
0,Shank N.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"I'll dive right into why i gave this place a 1star review. My gf ordered the laksa and i got the beef burger. I thought my burger was good,  however, my girlfriend  upon almost finishing off her meal, found a band aid wrapper on the bottom of her bowl. yes. A band aid wrapper. This was pretty shocking, to say the least. Althought, it seemed almost a natural climax to the whole experience. As to begin with, i was already put off by the noticably dirty fabric used on the chairs outdoors and the fact that one of drinks we ordered came in a glass with lipstick stains on it. Alexis left us feeling completly grossed out. My partner seem broderline traumatised by the whole experience. I should mention that the manager of the place was very apologetic and understanding. Still i wouldn't go back to this place if you paid me to."
0,Angeline C.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Alexis gave me this kind of very atas feeling to dine in, feel like you can't afford anything because the interior restaurant itself is like super comfy but also you will be very worry the price is super high or something :\ but then I think the money worth the try already,

their Pappardelle with Meatballs for me is amaze balls though, thought of it could be just average but the taste is right there, the meaty feeling is full filling my tummy :3 I recommend you guys to try their Slow Roasted Duck Magret, the meat roasted it well and everything is perfect :) the side salad is very refreshing with orange along with this dish :) personally thinking that these dish are awesome :) will come back with a special occasion :)"
0,Vivian Y.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Alexis is the perfect place to bring a date. It's a place to wind down after a day of work with some wine and good dessert. There are some nights where there would be jazz performances as well. They would also get some international acts. The wine list is pretty extensive, food considerably decent but slightly overpriced for what they may serve so don't expect too much and don't compare it with a high class restaurant.

I personally go there for their pavlova. It's what I live for in Alexis. The decor and lighting is very inviting for people who needs to relax and wind down as said earlier. There are also quite a few well-known people that goes to this bistro."
0,Mish C.,Alexis Bistro & Wine Bar,"Came here with a girlfriend 9pm for dessert and wine. Restaurant was only 30% filled with lots of empty tables but that didn't mean service was faster or attentice. As a matter of fact it took about 10 minutes before anyone came over with a menu. I was a bit disappointed already with the service. On with the dessert now...... peach pie was delicious except i didn't care for the bed of melted vanilla ice cream it sat on. Do we really need the extra calories? The peach crumble was delicious enough to enjoy as is. We also got the tiramisu which was good but not something i would return to. As for drinks, 2 of the 4 wines offer at fhe menu weren't available which was bizarre bc it strike me as a nice wine bar restaurant. Anyhow, i was left with the choice to order the more expensive red which was the pinot noir. Overall, my experience was a bit disappointed as I had high hopes for this spot based on the mini Time Out review I read. Perhaps, we came in on a slow week night where staff was short and availability in service was limited. I will try go on a Friday jazz night to get another feel."
0,Mish C.,Spring Garden Restaurant,"This spot is next to the discovery center so we came here afterwards. It is kid friendly and we here for lunch. Didn't get chance to look through the main menu but had their amazing dim sum. The congee was cooked to perfection w shredded fresh ginger and chicken. The steamed pork buns was delicious as both my 4 years old and 2 years old started to chow down. The shrimp har gow was so scrumptious I almost order another one. The service was highly attentive until it got extremely busy. We had a nice male waiter that kept coming to check on my tea and fill up my tea. I highly recommend this place for anyone that likes high quality Chinese cuisine. This was dim sum equivalent to best dim sums I had in Vancouver,  Hong Kong and Los Angeles!"
0,Jon L.,Spring Garden Restaurant,"Spring Garden is a Chinese restaurant located on the 4th floor of Suria KLCC, which is the mall below Petronas Towers in central Kuala Lumpur. I wanted to try dim sum in Malaysia for the first time, so I was looking for a place to try it at. I had walked by this restaurant on my first day in town before they were open. I took a look at their dim sum menu and came back the next day to give it a try.

This restaurant is part of the Tai Thong Group which runs a dozen Chinese restaurants in Malaysia. Half of those restaurants are non-halal, while the remaining are pork free. Spring Garden is one of those pork free restaurants, so you won't find any menu items here with that ingredient. Seeing as how a lot of my favorite dim sum dishes have pork in them, I was interested to know if the exclusion of that ingredient made a big difference in taste.

The interior of the restaurant is quite lovely. It is nicely adorned, without being too elegant. Casual dress is fine here. No need to dress up. In addition to serving Chinese fare, the restaurant also sells lunar mooncakes in many flavors and different styles (baked and snow) during the Mid-Autumn Festival season.

The dim sum prices here might be considered a bit high to locals, but I found them to be reasonably priced as many of them were US $2-3 each. Whereas you can expect to pay on average US $3.50 per dish in Seattle.

Ordered five items including shrimp dumplings, shreddded duck rice noodle rolls, steamed fish balls, radish cake with chicken floss and jade sesame balls. To accompany the dishes, I ordered a pot of pu-erh tea. Note that they charge for tea here, but worth getting nevertheless.

Overall, I enjoyed the dim sum here. The shredded duck rice noodle rolls really stood out. The texture of the duck is almost bacon like. The fish balls were also tasty, though I had plenty of it in KL. And if you like Chinese desserts, the jade sesame balls are a must order. The inside of the sesame balls has a green tea custard filling which was delicious.

To answer the question if I missed not having dim sum with pork in it, the answer is no. There is enough variety here that you won't miss it. As for rating the dim sum quality, I would say that it doesn't quite match up to HK or Vancouver dim sum, but I would rate it above dim sum in Honolulu and Seattle.

Ended up paying about US $16 for a dim sum lunch here. That includes a 10% service charge and 6% GST plus a small charge for a wet towel (RM1.50). I think that is a pretty reasonable price for the dim sum I had here and the service was good so I don't mind paying the charge for it.

If you are look for a restaurant with good dim sum and nice ambiance in central KL, I would recommend Spring Garden."
0,Sara M.,Spring Garden Restaurant,"Chinese Cuisine at it's best! these guys have some amazing side dishes from sauté vegetables with buttered prawns to the duck dishes! it's just incredible! the roaster duck dishes are my favourite when it comes to Chinese restaurants. quite honestly reviewing about it now makes me crave another plate.

Food in Malaysia is great but what I learned is that you must go out there and explore it. I promised myself to explore every bit of and that I will not regret any of it! and this place was just epic! I enjoyed it! it's one of those places I'll be remembering for sure!"
0,Nicole S.,Spring Garden Restaurant,"Spring Garden is a fine dining Chinese restaurant and even looks very expensive from the outside. I've only even been here about three times and all with a big group of friends. We usually order the buttered prawns, fried rice, Kai lan and of course the peking duck which is the highlight of Spring Garden. I really liked how the prepared and served the peking duck, similar to Duck King. The meat was moist and juicy, the skin crispy and so flavorful im salivating just thinking about it.

Spring Garden is expensive cause its a fancy place. The food however is worth the price. The ambiance is good but can get quite noisy when its a full house. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion with delicious chinese food then this is the place for you."
0,Michael S.,Spring Garden Restaurant,"Popped in for lunch one Sunday afternoon around 4pm. Unsurprisingly quiet, but the staff were friendly and efficient.
Perfectly acceptable dim sum, if not an extensive offering.
Restaurant was a liitle dimly lit, but food was well-presented and tasty!"
0,Jasmine C.,Dewakan,"I am most excited about Dewakan not because it's fine dining but because it's modern fine dining featuring Malaysian produce and ingredients. I have been here for two menu sets (they just changed to the second this Nov) and I am still excited and can't wait to see what more brilliant dishes Chef Darren Teoh comes up with!

The location may be a little odd given that it's in a college uni but the chef is a lecturer there which explains the link. There are one or two dishes per set course that doesn't quite do it for me but I am still intrigued with his creativity and play with our local ingredients. I have been blown away with some of the dishes too like the roast mushrooms, prawns with crunchy prawn head etc and the ice creams (pisang goreng! Pulut! Gandum!). And of course it helps that plating is gorgeous.

And i do appreciate that the lunch and dinner here can be affordable too. But most of all, i applaud their effort and mission to highlight local produce in such a modern gastronomic experience. Dewakan is one to look out for!"
0,Michelle W.,Dewakan,Hands down my favorite restaurant in KL! Modern fine dining featuring local Malaysian ingredients and flavors (Think Noma in Copenhagen or Locavore in Ubud Bali...)  I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity and the perfect execution bringing different palettes and textures all together!  Chef Darren Teoh has a cool vision.  Totally worth getting out of the city to indulge yourself in this well curated culinary experience.
0,Shaun K.,Dewakan,"Not open on Sunday.  Hmm strange the gods don't eat on Sundays?

They said they might change. Once they do, perhaps my ratings would change as well"
0,Sue F.,Dewakan,"The location is a bid odd, but I think Dewakan may be the best fine dining restaurant in KL at the moment. You have to cross over the KDU university campus to find it, but once you get in, you'll feel like you're in any other restaurant in the city.

The service is really, really good and the food is next level stuff. The chef (Darren Teoh) uses mostly local ingredients and the flavours are Malaysian too. It's strange to taste Malaysian flavours instead of French or European in a fine dining restaurant, but he does it really well. The best part: It's so affordable. A ten-course menu is RM175, which is the kind of price you can never find in KL. At Sage I think it's that price for three courses.

There's one dish that's like a Chinese coffee shop porridge but a fine dining version with mushroom consommé.  And they have this gula Melaka dessert with pulut ice cream that is so, so clever. Next time I have an occasion to celebrate and I want nice food, I will definitely go back to Dewakan. But one thing that sucks is they don't have wine! So it's BYO for now."
0,Ryan P.,Tao Chinese Cuisine,"Came here to enjoy some dim sum, and was not disappointed. There menu is pretty robust, featuring an array of seafood to beef and everything in between. Got here as soon as they opened up and was the first to be seated, Wednesday afternoon, for lunch. We ordered the soup of the day, some fried rice, a few orders of different types of dim sum, and roast duck on the side. The order we placed came in no particular order, with the rice coming out in the middle of it all, which leads me to suspect that they were not ready for us. As we finished up lunch more patrons started to arrive and the place filled up quickly. All in all the food was great, and service was pleasant, and I got exactly what I wanted."
0,Jasmine C.,Mero-Nepal Restaurant,"Spotted this Nepalese place as I was having a cuppa opposite at LOKL Coffee one day and since then have been back twice to have Nepalese fare. Simple restaurant upstairs with air-cond.

I love their beautifully pleated momos and their rice dhal bhat sets. All very homecooked feel to it but sometimes that is the beauty of Nepalese food. Reasonably priced too."
0,Jeremy G.,WIP,"Probably my favorite restaurant in KL and a must visit whenever I'm in town.

WIP is a large restaurant and bar space and depending on what you're looking for, it caters to everyone from quiet drinkers (on their al fresco patio) to upmarket diners (their inside upper deck).

One thing that is consistent throughout the eclectic atmosphere is the quality of their food and the great service.

My favorites are the deep fried chicken wings (best I've ever had) and the chicken makanwala which is like a butter chicken.

The wings are always flavorful, meaty and crisp, while the chicken makanwala has the most buttery and well spiced curry sauce I've eaten so far. One thing they could improve on is having fresher and more crisped up naan that they serve as an accompaniment.

The drinks are well made and we love stopping by for their happy hour that runs until 8pm - that in itself is kind of crazy but long happy hours are typical in Asia. Try the mojitos!

Service is friendly and generally quick. The place does get busy though so make a reservation if you need a table in the evenings."
0,Fitfun F.,WIP,Lychee cocktails. Chicken tikka & soft shelled crab. Funky Musik and hot sounds. After work drinks with snacks. The fried food went well with drinks. No table dancing? Aw sheesh.......
0,Adelynn T.,WIP,"A happening place among the work force! Was here for a birthday celebration last night. This place is quite hippity hops. Many people are here for drinks and good dinner to unwind after a stressful work day.

It wasn't my first time here but it's still as good as it was last time. I was here around 7pm. There were a lot of people. Love the interior. Nothing super fancy or intimidating....The bottles of liquors and wine were placed neatly in the cooler.

We were sat at the table nearby the garden (still inside of the restaurant). Table decoration is quite neat and nice. No fancy mancy napkins..but serving plates and candle.

When we were ordering, the waiter was very nice and patient enough to recommend us food and beverage. I had the carbonara spaghatti with beef bacon while meow had the chicken skewer served with couscous and vegetables of the day. Sauces were three types of sauces...which i can't really remember except that they had mushroom sauce and chili sauce. For beverages, i had summer passion tea (passion fruit tea) and Meow had the iced chocolate. The food portion is quite huge. So do share if you plan to have a main course.

Service was good and fast. The waiters/waitresses were attentive and patient.

Overall experience : 5/5
Price Rating : 4/5"
0,Stephanie X.,WIP,"WIP is definitely one of my favourite spots in Bangsar, along with the other 100 people. This place is definitely a crowd puller. With their extensive range of Mojitos such as the 'sweet basil & asam boi' to their classic Manhattan martinis, you'd find this place packed on weekdays & weekends!
No stranger to Happy hour promotions & champagne buffet brunches; it's definitely 'the bar' to unwind. Here they do accept reservations but just like any other hotspot it can be difficult to get a table. Not surprising to many, the food here is extremely tasty aswell. I've had expat friends tell me that they'd come here just for the North Indian meals like the butter chicken with naan or rice & the mutton masala. Indian food is not all I have to rave about. The pizzas are nothing short of awesome especially when you want something light to go down easy with the drinks, try the margarita pizza!"
0,Simina I.,WIP,"I came here once with some girls to have dinner and enjoy some drinks. I loved the place from the moment I entered because it's full with expats.

The menu is clear and not too exhaustive, but offering enough variety in terms of cuisines. The meal arrived within 10 minutes (despite being full and my caesar salad was full of lean meat..as opposed to just a couple of chunks in most salads elsewhere), portion not too big but was filling enough.

If you are a vegetarian, you are lucky...the place have lots of veggie options and plentiful portions well worth a visit.

Service in this place is the best i've received in Malaysia (in 7 months for far). Attentive waiters, always with a smile on their faces, joking around, funny but not pushy. At the end of the meal they hand you a feedback sheet, so I suppose they are interested in making what they offer even better.

After 22, the music is turned louder and the DJ starts mixing into the night.

Excellent value, bill was bearable for the experience of a very good night out...well recommended"
0,Diana C.,WIP,"I've had such a great experience in WIP, at a very special day for me. I celebrated my birthday there and I couldn't have been more satisfied.

WIP is a large bar in BSC with an awesome selection of food and drinks. Although a bit pricey, the quality was really good. The waiters got a photo of me and my friends, then printed it for me as a memento, which was really sweet!

The only downside to this place is that they can be a bit annoying about reservations (calling people multiple times to confirm, etc) but I still find it one of the best services I've seen in KL."
0,Nicole S.,WIP,"WIP is a really cool hangout spot at Bangsar. Its located beside Bangsar Shopping Centre and is an all in one place. They serve amazing food, and have a wide array of cocktails etc to choose from for after dinner drinks. They have 4 different dining sections. The garden, the patio etc. when i visited it was just for drinks, so we sat inside where the atmosphere mimicked a club scene.

I honestly loved the environment here as it had a really nice ambiance, good music and excellent service. Although they were so busy we got our drinks really fast. We also ordered a plate of fried calamari and it was really good too. Crunch batter, and fresh squid. The dip was a mayo based dip and was yummy and went well with the squid.

Looked through the menu and there's a wide variety of food to choose from, they have asian and western. Prices are a bit on the high side. But the food and ambiance is worth it. Would definitely be back here soon for some dinner and drinks after."
0,Marija S.,WIP,"This is definitely a place where you want to take your friends that are visiting you in Kuala Lumpur or invite someone on a date! The design of the restaurant is just breathtaking. You have dimmed lights and romantic atmosphere inside, while outside you  have very fancy sofas and round tables surrounded by torches!

I definitely recommend to try their Dragon fruit Mojito and Caesar salad! Even though the restaurant is pricey compared to standard prices in KL, it is definitely worth a visit!

It is also a place that people love to celebrate birthdays, somehow each time I went there I've always heard people singing Happy Birthday :) !"
0,Rebecca W.,WIP,"""Whipped Into Place"" or commonly known as ""WIP"" has been a famous chill out spot in Bangsar for many people. It's one of my favourite place to hang out too. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to get a seat there. WIP has a urban-tropical design which some cosy sofas at their outdoor sitting.

Most of the time, people are there for their Mojitos. Frankly, I think they served the best and cheapest Mojitos in Bangsar Shopping Centre. They are so famous for Mojitos that they actually have a long list of different Mojitos on their menu. For the less adventurous souls, go for their Pandan Lychee Mojito, which they added homemade pandan syrup into the drink; or else, you can try their Asam Boi or Ginger Blush. Apart from the drinks, they have pretty delicious food on the menu too. They serve a selections of Western, Local and Northern Indian cuisine. I tried their Chicken Vindaloo and liked it a lot, especially with naan.

Overall, WIP is a nice place to chill with friends to have a drink or 2 and maybe order some food to go with. However, the music tends to get too loud and might not be an ideal place chit-chatting. Also, it's always safer to make reservation when you plan to go WIP; and it's advisable to make it 1 week ahead instead of few days before."
0,John F.,WIP,"Everything here was sub par at best.  It may be a decent happening place, but the food is just OK.  We had 3 different kinds of fish at the table... all 3 were dry and overcooked.  The only thing on the table that was good was the soft shell crab."
0,Intan N.,WIP,"WIP is one of those restaurants in bsc where you can have good food, drinks and loud music.

I usually go here because of someone's birthday and it is a nice atmosphere for young adults to celebrate coming of age parties. I used to love the fish and chips but they changed the menu and style of it so not my favourite anymore but I like the churros, crispy but not too skinny.

Almost borderline club at night but still family friendly during the day. They have good service and have good deals on drinks before 8pm"
0,Khalisah K.,WIP,"I've celebrated three of my birthdays here! I just love this place. I love the how the menu has a bit of everything from western and asian dishes that way everyone is happy!

I like sitting outside, especially at night when BSC switches on their fairy lights which are dangling from the big tress alongside the road and the restaurant.. Its just so pretty! I love it!

I could stay here for hours over drinks and snacks yapping away! This is where id usually end up during weekends. Happy hour promos are very good too and will be hard to resist."
0,Zhenchi L.,WIP,"Whipped Into Place!

WIP is definitely one of the better bars in the Bangsar area. You can expect to come across plenty of expatriates and professionals letting their hair down for the night.

I came here over the weekend and I must say I had a great time. The staff were very polite and promptly showed us to the table upon arrival.

WIP is well known for their cocktails and food. My friends ordered some mojitos and I had the molten lava cake, they were delicious!

I was flipping through the food menu and I must say I was impressed with the selection available. They had all sorts of cuisine, from indian to italian.

It was a shame that I didn't get to try the food here. I will be back soon to have a meal!

It gets really busy over the weekends so I'd recommend making a reservation to avoid having to wait for a table."
0,Ian L.,WIP,"Known for its array versions of Mojitos, you are spoilt for choices at this outpost in BSC. Crowd is a mix of well-heeled suburbans and nine-to-fivers nearby.
  Their mojitos, as usual, stole the limelight when we dropped by recently. Our favorites are the classics, dragonfruit and lycee. It is easy to have one too many drinks and forgot entirely about the food. It would be a shame if that happened since their fusion cuisine here is pretty remarkable."
0,Azraai A.,WIP,"Cleverly named Work In Progress, this bar remains to be one of my favorite watering holes. The staff is friendly and the crowd that occupies it is a healthy variation of professional singles, power couples, family units and sexy swingers (I don't know actually, but some really do look like swingers to me.)

The outlook of the bar is a blend between the tropical amazon jungle with a hint of the Aztec factor thrown in. Its fun, spacious and on Friday and Saturday nights, Loud. They have wonderful happy hour rates there that's sure to keep you coming back for more. I have always opted to sit outside as the indoor area can get quite packed during peak hours. But ever since the place opened and slowly gained popularity amongst party and bar goers, the place has been overly packed and the prices has since then soared exponentially.

I have since then opted for other places to wet my throat which aren't so expensive (or maybe it's a good stopping point for my drinking habit!) but WIP will always have a special place in my heart."
0,Joanna N.,WIP,"WIP is one of the best places for a chilled out fun night with a big group of people. The interior is really nice and classy. There is a bar for people to sit at and they make really nice cocktails for those interested (eg. mango melon margarita, asam boi mojito). As for the food, they provide western dishes like crab cake, branzino and chicken chimichanga.They also have asian food as well. For their indian dishes, which actually tastes pretty decent, I particularly enjoyed the chicken tikka. They have comfy couch areas for people to chill at but  keep in mind that it is a little hard to have your meals there."
0,Malcolm O.,WIP,Great bar. Great food. Responsive and quick service. Reasonable prices. Great fun. Arguably the best bar/restaurant in Bangsar. Highly recommended.
0,Jen L.,Segambut Yong Tau Foo,"A mixture of Yong Tau Fu and Steamboat at this place, i wrote a review about my steamboat experience here (HOHO steamboat), One thing why i love this place to eat IPOH YONG TAU FU it is because some deep frieds are homemade and i like people who does homemade then pre-made. Homemade, you get to taste more meat and more fresh.

The fishball soup is really good and the FU CHOK is amazing! Crispy outside and inside fish paste, so so yummy! I got eat 2 plates of that. It is up to you if you want to do steamboat Young Tau Fu or ala carte which means without steamboat. If you steamboat, you could change the flavour of your soup by adding in ingredients but as for ala carte, they will serve you what they have. LOVE THE FISHBALLS!

It is a must to come here when you are around this area. It really gives me the taste of back to Ipoh."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Segambut Yong Tau Foo,"Previously known as jalan Ipoh Yong Tou Fu, this place is now renamed as the Segambut Yong Tou Fu and jalan Ipoh Yong Tou Fu had been moved to a nearby location, in Cairnhill Hotel. Working nearby and wanted to experiment if the place is still as good, I finally visited the place with my colleague today.

This place is hard to miss, a big old bungalow building with a big sign. However, do note that the traffic is a bit complicated here, so you better google map it first if it's your first time here.

There are quite a lot of parking spaces here which however quickly get filled up once it's lunch hours, so if you don't want to park too far away and walk over under the scorching sun, do plan to come slightly earlier.

They have a very wide range of yong tau fu here of course, which are actually some food ingredients like vegetables and tou fu stuffed with minced meat.

Besides that, they actually have stalls here selling buns, fruit rojak, fried prawn crackers, steamed sweet potato and so much more.

So, if you are looking forward to spoil yourself with choices, you would want to check this place out for yourself. Their price list here in fact isn't too expensive either, so that's a good part!

One thing - you might need to bear with the hot weather when you're dining here as it could get quite hot in the afternoons!

If you are okay with the weather, by all means check the place out!"
0,Alexis G.,Segambut Yong Tau Foo,"This is a popular place to have yong tau foo in Segambut ! It's gonna be either this, or Jalan Ipoh Yong Tau Foo which is opening across it in a few weeks. The other outlet wins this because of the Che Cheong Fun. They only serve this with rice which is kind of sad.

The food that is good would be the fried dumpling skin with fish paste. Crunchy on the outside and oily moist on the on the inside! My favourite is the ladies finger and stuffed with fish paste. I wonder how they can consistently get big sized ladies finger and the brown sauce with that they dip it in complements it well without overpowering it. Sprinkle it wieh some chopped onion leaves, take a bite and wham, there you go a perfect bite of yong tahu foo in my mouth."
0,Ellen H.,Strato,Awesome view and impeccable food. Located on the highest level of a exclusive residential building. I think it's perfect place for a romantic dinner over watching the night view of KL.
0,Gizelle A.,Strato,Lovely restaurant serving Italian food. It has two levels : one of the 23rd floor and then twisty steps up on more level. I went to both. One night I went by myself and had the Wagyu pasta dish. It was delicious but very small. I left hungry. Came back the next day with a group - took my team from work to dinner there. We ordered a variety of items off the menu and liked all. The employees were super attentive to us. They were available at all times and were very prompt to respond. I found the seating on the lower level much more comfortable. Soft chairs! I'd be happy to go back and would recommend
0,Eveline L.,Strato,"When you arrive at Level 23A, you will be greeted by a staff and asked which restaurant you are dining at. Walking into Claret bar, you will definitely notice the BEAUTIFUL staircase leading up to Strato. Yes, you have to walk up the stairs so try not to wear killer heels or super duper short skirt to avoid any unwanted embarrassment.

The view here is great without a doubt however I would appreciate more space between the tables for more privacy. After all this is sort of like a fine dining place. We got the mussels and clam and it came with two bread on top. It was the only dish that I find a little underwhelming. The taste is just too subtle. The Wagyu ravioli was superb with the beef melting in my mouth. The pan seared duck was the highlight of our meal as the flavours were just so on point. Try their tiramisu for dessert. It is really good and rich in flavour.

Best of all, the prices here are actually quite reasonable for the ambiance and food quality."
0,Nicole S.,Strato,"The one and only time I dined at Strato was on October 25th 2014, my anniversary. Strato is an Italian restaurant situated in the very affluent Troika building on Jalan Binjai. To me it was quite fancy although a little noisy. It was a saturday night you see and besides making reservations, we still had to wait quite a while to be seated. We didn't mind though because we were asked to wait at the gorgeous Claret wine bar which is just down the spiral stairs.

Menu here confused me because it was quite fancy and I dont do fancy. Regardless teh waiter was very helpful and explained close to everything to us and we decided on what we would have, We ordered a pasta with clams, a pizza and a cream dessert. to be honest my favorite was the dessert, it was creamy and sweet and rich. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Strato is definitely expensive but i guess its only for special occasions, unless you're rich of course then go ahead and dine in anytime you want ;)

Ambiance was very good. This is mainly because its called 'sky dining at troika' so you're pretty much guaranteed a gorgeous view of the Kuala Lumpur City skyline. To be honest I think i set my expectations to high, cause i didn't think it was that gorgeous, also they needed to clean teh glass windows. I mean whats a good view for if you have dirty windows right?"
0,Carmen L.,Strato,"Strato is one of the restaurants they have here in Troika. Strato is an Italian restaurant that serves up luxurious and delicious meals. The setting of the place is romantic and is a perfect place to have an anniversary/birthday dinner. I came here not too long ago for a birthday with friends.

The food here was very delicious and was served quite fast. We ordered a trio bruschetta (RM18++) and a squid ink pasta (RM55++) and an Italian Sausage Pizza (RM30++) and we didn't regret it at all. The staffs here are very friendly and they greeted us with a warm welcome. To me, I think that the price for the food is worth it for it' s taste. The interior of the place was beautiful, especially the spiral stairs. [Do take note that while walking up the spiral stairs, it is pretty steep and it isn't covered, so try not to wear such tall heels or short skirts].

Strato can get pretty crowded during the weekends, so I suggest that you make reservations few days before the day of your dinner. The downside to this restaurant is that there isn't so much of a view compared to the other restaurants here in Troika. My view of the night was a construction site in the city and skyscrapers and other tall structures of buildings. But overall, we had a nice birthday dinner and it was definitely worth it!"
0,Abdullah Al A.,Strato,"Great place, amazing views to spend your evening there. Comes with a very fair price tag. We had pizza and pasta, they offer good range of choices. The drinks choices don't fall short anywhere as well, are simply excellent. The staff attended with precise attention, we really liked the recommended desert. We wanted to have a walk,we were only allowed up to the bridge which isn't best but understandable. We had picked a balcony table and it was the right choice, best way to spend a KL evening will surely come back and highly recommend to others."
0,Nicole S.,Kin Kin Pan Mee @ Pandan Indah,"Kin Kin is the best pan mee that i've ever had and i frequent this place all the time because i just love their pan mee. It can get really busy during the lunch hour and on weekends but they have extended the seating area so its not so hard to find a table.

The wait can get a little long when they are busy but on usual days its super fast. The pan mee here is always cooked to perfection, the egg always perfectly poached, the minced pork seasoned deliciously and the ikan bilis fried till crispy. And  now my tummy is rumbling haha!

Any pan mee lover should try kin kin and the best part is this restaurant is fully air conditioned so its comfy to eat here even on a hot day."
0,Su Zanne C.,Kin Kin Pan Mee @ Pandan Indah,"I brought my Japanese friend here and she said she absolutely loved it.
This would be the second dry chili pan mee that I've tried after Madam Chiam, and honestly speaking, I preferred Kin Kin's pan mee over Madam Chiam's because they had slightly more ingredients in it, most importantly the vegetable, and I loved how their half boiled egg is done. My guy friends though, preferred Madam Chiam because Madan Chiam had more minced meat in it. To each its own.

This outlet in Pandan Indah takes up two corner lots. Inside, it is air conditioned and the place is relatively clean.

The food comes quickly, and the price is reasonable.

Kin Kin is still my favourite chili pan mee restaurant."
0,Abel K.,Kin Kin Pan Mee @ Pandan Indah,Spicy pan mee... Ok. Arrogant servers. Nothing else to write.. Crowded during peak hours. Floors are dirty. Aircond is not cold.
0,Vanessa W.,Kin Kin Pan Mee @ Pandan Indah,kin kin chili pan mee have a very old history . It was originally open under a tree and now they have upgraded themselves to an air-conditional shop which located at pandan indah . What is so special about this pan mee? The owner of the shop actually made their own chili with their secret recipes. Cannot deny that their chili is super delicious. It is now very famous as many people will purposely come from very far just to try their chili pan mee. They have two shops now. One is at the original place where they started their business 10 years ago and another one is located at Pandan Indah . This Pandan Indah outlet is now belongs to the owner's son . The son took over his father's business and upgraded themselves to an air-conditioning shop while the original shop is still belongs to the father . Some of them says that the old shop is nicer . But to me both shops are the same . The restaurant usually have a lot of people . Sometimes we might have to wait for 20 minutes just for a bowl of chili pan mee. I usually will just take away as I doesn't not like to wait for the table.
0,Catalina C.,Restoran Wan Fo Yuan,"This Buddhist restaurant claims to be vegetarian, however I clearly saw some fried fish on the menu. I shared a lovely chestnut and mushroom filled dumpling soup with a friend for RM7.50. The broth was simple but good, I loved the flavor combination of the dumplings. The owner assured me that the fish sauce was really vegetarian, as did he understand what vegan meant.

The atmosphere was very local and seemed authentic. Great location close to China town, the Sri Mahamariamman temple and the Central Market for a little sightseeing afterwards.

Pros: Chestnut mushroom dumplings, Great location for sightseeing , Local atmosphere

Cons: Looks like there is fish on the menu"
0,Juan S.,Restoran Wan Fo Yuan,Great vegan Chinese restaurant. Always good food here. Tried the vegan curry lamb and is delicious. House Specialty here. Fried oyster mushroom with sweet and sour sauce is really good. The breading is light and fluffy. Great neighborhood vegetarian restaurant I been going since I was a kid.
0,Vivian Y.,Restaurant Sun Gee,"There are tons of Chinese food right here at this restaurant. It's practically a self service kinda place, where you pick the dishes and pay at the end of the counter. There are also soft drinks for your liking. You can help yourself to some iced tea and water in the middle of the restaurant as well.

Parking can be a little tough cause the streets are pretty narrow around the area. It's pretty easy to spot but bear in mind there are a couple of mixed rice restaurants on that street itself. The food is just really of especially for how much you're paying. I only paid 7.50rm for the portion I had. It was so good. They also grow their own vegetables and they would sell it in the morning before lunch time where they set up all the dishes."
0,Wallace Y.,Restaurant Sun Gee,"I am big fan of this place in Cheras. The food is great and you will be amazed by the number of dishes they put out here for both lunch and dinner. This is my childhood favourite Chinese Economy Rice and I've watched them grow from occupying a smaller space to a bigger one now. I've moved away from Cheras for many years now but everytime I'm in the area, I'll always grab a chance to drop by."
0,Jason Y.,RSMY,"RSMY aka Restoran Selera My is known for allegedly the best cheese naan in KL. True enough, it certainly did not disappoint me. The cheese naan was already cut up and when I lifted up a piece, it was akin to pulling out a slice of cheesy pizza, extra cheese. And to be honest, it actually taste quite similar to how a cheesy stuffed crust pizza would taste like, minus the toppings. However, what I really liked wasn't the naan but the mutton keema which was amazingly tasty. I ordered it without knowing what it was but I can say I wasn't disappointed. The tandoori chicken was also really good as they use a different type of marinate as compared to the normal mamak tandoori. However the tandoori chicken was a little bit pricey at rm10. I compared this to a benchmark I set which is Nasi kandar kayu whose tandoori chicken is only rm8 and kayu is known to be expensive already. All in all, it is definitely a must try and I would definitely recommend ordering the mutton keema and tandoori. These compliments the naan really well as the naan by itself has nothing much to shout about."
0,Maryam H.,RSMY,"Environment is so noisy, at night, there are several musicians that come over and play their music to the max. Not only that, but it disturbs and disrespects the people who came from work and seriously need to eat some dinner before they sleep. Second, some of the employees didn't wash their hands before preparing some of the dishes that I ordered, meaning that sanitation at this restaurant is a problem. Also, the tandoori chicken I received was really dry and felt like precooked chicken. Never going to this place ever again, I'd rather eat at McDonald's lmao."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Maria's Steakcafe Bangsar,"Having first tried Maria's Steakcafe back in Ipoh years ago, this place has always been one of my favourite spots for steak. As someone who hangs out a lot in Bangsar, I'm actually very glad that Maria's is finally here!

Price tags here might be slightly expensive but not so much if you are talking about dining spots in Kuala Lumpur, and especially Bangsar - so, it's the ordinary Kuala Lumpur price range.

Taste wise, I would give a thumbs up.
They grill pretty good steaks here and their beefs are all quite fresh, as they are quite a demanded restaurant so the beefs sell out pretty quickly I suppose.

One thing to compliment here is that they treat their side dishes pretty seriously as well here. so, you don't get grilled vegetables that are not fresh. They usually serve their steaks here with grilled vegetables and they do give you quite a generous portion of them, all crispy and juicy, grilled to goodness!

Apart from their steaks here, their coffee here is not too bad either. However, I of course would not come here purposely for their coffee. It's just that if you need a fix after your heavy dinner, you can stay here and get a cuppa joe - all good!

Environment wise, the place is pretty comfortable and you won't feel too cramped up. The only challenging part here is that you might struggle to find a parking spot, so, good luck on that - it's Bangsar babe!"
0,Ash H.,Maria's Steakcafe Bangsar,"Maria's is one of my go-to places for steaks, mainly because of its no-frills dining and genuinely good steaks. Bangsar has become a hub for fancy dining experiences, and while there are many great places around the Telawi area, some tend to be more show than substance. Maria's is a great example of honest and genuinely good steaks without the fancy interior / decor.

Steaks here are consistently good and probably better than the nearby Ril's. I have tried both places several times and I'm leaning towards Maria's mainly because of value-for-money. You can end up blowing RM400-500 on a meal at Ril's while Maria's is about half the price. If you don't want to go for the wagyu at Maria's the angus is also good. Start with the oysters and end with a tiramisu.

I have no complains about the service at Maria's either. Overall a solid place for steaks where I repeatedly visit."
0,Lucie B.,CaliBurger,Even I feel strange giving a 5 star review to a fast food place but the burgers here are seriously good! Basically it's identical to an In-N-Out burger and unlikely every other fastfood place in Malaysia the burgers are made when you order them so they're fresh and hot and mmmm so delicious. The onion rings and fries are also bomb!
0,Amirul R.,CaliBurger,"I went here not expecting to like it, let alone to love it -- but wow, what a place! The menu options are limited (there's little reason to go for anything other than the standard CaliBurger, in my opinion) but you know this is better than your average fast food place. They cook every burger fresh once you order. The CaliBurger itself was delicious and juicy... everything a burger needs. Something sometimes so hard to find in KL!"
0,Nicole S.,Astana Restaurant,"If you're looking for authentic Russian/Khazhak food, this is the place to go. My Russian friend brought a bunch of us here since we've been nagging him for ages,and he guaranteed that this is one of the most authentic places in Malaysia.

We ordered a mini feast that night. We started off with""Lepeshki"" which is a round bread with melted cheese baked into the centre accompanied by carrots in vinegar and a side stew. Next we got ""Uigir Lagman"" which is a beef based stew with
potatoes,cabbage,carrots and bell peppers. Thick and slightly spicy, perfect for the chilly,rainy evening we were having. Next we got ""Zharkoe"" which is basically beef stew, kebab style accompanied by a side of baked potatoes and slices of cucumber. Meat was tasty though a little chewy. The baked potatoes were brushed with a sort of garlic herb butter that gave them a nice garlic taste.

""Vareniki"" is a dumpling stuffed with mashed potatoes and herbs. A little on the tasteless side in my opinion. The skin of the dumpling is almost exactly the same as a Japanese Gyoza dumpling skin. For dessert we ordered a traditional Khazak dessert, which is a thick pastry like shell filled with sweetened condensed milk."
0,Hannah E.,Sang Kee Restaurant,"Even though Sang Kee was very close to my hotel, my preference was to go to Pan Heong up near the Batu Caves for sang har mee. Pan Heong was closed though, which we didn't find out until a convoluted cab tour of what felt like the entirety of Selangor, so by the time we made it to Sang Kee we were VERY cranky.

We took one of the last tables right out from under the noses of a group of three guys - sorry guys - and were escorted to a magazine write up on the wall in lieu of a menu. No matter; we already knew what we wanted.

Sang har mee ""for two"" came with four giant curly prawns and a total mess of delicious springy noodles, all covered in a rich orangy sauce with circles of bitter ginger hiding among them. I loved this sauce, and the noodles, and the process of peeling the shrimp meat from its sturdy shell. One prawn was noticeably fresher than the other, but both were at least good.

Could have used some fruit juice with this rich dish, but settled for a strong nonsugary limeade instead.

Tip: you have to go INSIDE this building block to find this restaurant, down a very narrow alley teeming with cats, and there are no English signs."
0,Yi En N.,Bacons & Balls,"Great lasagna
Bread pudding has too much ingredients - cranberry, ice cream, nuts, bacon...
4 stars due to service and lasagna"
0,Sara M.,Nando's,"Everyone knows and talks about Nando's. I can't even count how many people recommended me Nando's before I went and tried it out! I think it's just perfect! I had a great time with friends and we enjoyed the food! we tried to order different dishes and we had so much fun just ordering till we found that we took way more than what we can eat!

The staff are really cool and funny! you'll surely have a blast! just stay positive, put up a smile and go enjoy a great meal tonight!"
0,Greg R.,Nando's,"Meeting my wife's old friend, she really wanted to go to Nando's because there are not many in the U.S. (or at least near us in Texas) and she wanted a taste of home.

My wife reeaally wanted the fries. Can't argue, they were good fries - though it's hard to mess up fries.

The chicken and condiments were tasty. We got the spiciest/hottest level for the chicken which was not as hot as I was expecting - then again my heat tollerance is through the roof.

Portions are modest, could of been larger. Then again, I'm from Texas,  where everyhting is big. So my perception may be a bit biased :)"
0,Simina I.,Nando's,"I have to say that I'm not a fan of this place. But I always end here for dinner or lunch if I go with my friends from work. They love the place.

The food is good and their special sauce is delicious. But I'm not a fan of the food here because the chicken is to dry and the menu is very poor. They don't offer so many options. The price is good and the food is served quite fast. But if you go here for lunch or dinner the place is full and you may not find an empty table.

Overall: I do recommend the place."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Nando's,"Another favourite place for getting chicken in Nu Sentral for me, apart from Kenny Rogers Roasters. This outlet is a very popular one I would say as it's always crowded. If you come after six during weekdays and want to have dinner here, be ready to wait in the queue!

Their chicken here are served in different level of spiciness, so remember to request for less spicy ones if you are not someone who could stand extra spicy food. Otherwise, please go all out and request for the spiciest one!

Also, if you love spicy food, don't forget to request for their garlic peri-peri sauce, it's awesome - trust me. Beside that, their soft drinks are bottomless here, so drink all you want as it gets a bit too spicy!"
0,Oflavia V.,Nando's,"From all Nando's branches, I think Nu Sentral has the best services. They are very attentive, it doesn't take too many effort to call for help even though most of the time the places are in full house. People there are very polite, greet you in smile, and of course food is awesome.

One thing only is that the places is quite pack and narrow so sometime it could be so noisy. The wi-fi doesn't really work quite well as well. As for food, I love their quarter chicken with two sideline. They have selections of sideline like Mediterranean rice, chips, potato wedges, coleslaw, grilled veggie, and Fino sidelines that is more expensive like their appetising sweet potato, spinach and three bean salad (but you can only choose one for this). You need to try their angry mango burger, and peri wings as another options, plus get all your dishes dipped into their combination of garlic, hot sauce and with slight of peri sprinkle.

Other than try do try out their designer drinks like caiperinha, rosa fresca and my favourite is Citra, it is so refreshing! Plus their dessert like custard tart is something you have to take bite on before leaving Nando's!"
0,Vanessa O.,Dragon Door Inn Steamboat Restaurant,"Dragon Door Inn Steamboat Restaurant is really a local hidden gem located in Taman Segar Cheras Kuala Lumpur. Coming to dine at this place is both blessing and disguise. Why I say so it is because the food is definitely attractive but getting a parking here is a terrible mess! It is located on the first floor and you will have to climb up the stairs to go up to the shop. Seating arrangements and the tables are comfortable and relaxing.

The entire place is decorated beautifully as it gives you an ancient china feel to it. You can have a great time having your tea time or dinner here with a bunch of friends and the menu for this is extensive - the soup itself has a few different flavours for you to choose.

The seafood, meat and vegetable is extremely fresh that make the food here exceptionally good! Overall, I really like coming here because of its yummy food and beautiful atmosphere. Price? It is very reasonable!"
0,Simina I.,Vineria.It,"Do you like Italian Cuisine? If yes, great. I found the perfect place where you can have some Italian food in a perfect ambience.

The restaurant is divided into 2 areas: smoking outside and non-smokers inside. The area from outside has nice lounge sofas which are perfect foe a relaxing evening.

Apart from its normal menu, they have special menu depending on ingredients they have on the day. I had the lobster with squid-ink spaghetti on my visit. The dish was very nicely prepared, though a bit salty. As for desserts, their panna cotta and tiramisu with macadamia are yummy.

They have a great list of wine to choose from, that is what I really like about this place. Atmosphere is really good, but I think their tables are displayed quite close to each other, that makes the place a bit squeeze, especially when you sit down you will feel that.

Their staff are really attentive and helpful with the food menu and wine selections, imported from Italy.

P.S. They always have internet issue, so the Wifi is not working."
0,Alexandra M.,Vineria.It,"I was here during lunch time last week and I loved it. We were a very big group of people so the food options were good quite fast and took a bit longer till everything was refilled but the food was amazing.

It was a buffet option and the food was absolutely delicious. As any reputable Italian restaurant they had pasta, lasagna, pizza, salads and more. I loved the pasta and the pizza the most and they had this little salty breads that were very crunchy. They also offered coocked tongue and soups, fruits and deserts.

Their wine selections is quite impressive and the interior decor is fabulous. I really enjoyed this place so if you are craving so Italian cusine do check Vineria.It out."
0,Anna A.,Vineria.It,"If you're a fan of Italian food, then this place is one you should check out. They have great pizzas and pastas to suit every tastebud. The restaurant itself is very big with both indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is tasteful and the ambience is nice too.

I recently came here for breakfast one day as my sister and I wanted someplace quiet where we could talk and surprisingly this place offers a breakfast menu. I had just eggs and toast but the eggs were done well and the bread used for the toast was delicious too. My orange juice had too much ice for my liking so next time I will have to remember to tell them 'less ice'.

My sister ordered something that was described as just 'toast' on the menu but came looking like a grilled sandwich and it looked and tasted yummy. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat in the mornings at BSC then try this place out."
0,Stephanie X.,Vineria.It,"Red-sauce & carbonara sort of Italian restaurants are inundating the streets of Kuala Lumpur. Unusual in the past, they now seem to have a spot on menus in almost every western and/or fusion restaurant irrespective of their true ethnic specialities.
I am truly fond of my pasta's & pizza's thus if need be on that particular day when I crave it the most, I'd look no further then dining in a true authentic Italian spot. Vineria Bangsar is just the place I'd go to. This restaurant cum wine bar brings you back to the old school Italian dining. It commemorates everything essential in making your experience truly a heart Italian one!
Massimiliano, aka Max is the owner come head chef at this Vineria where he is known for his lamb specialities. He still takes full charge of the kitchen making sure quality is not compromised.
Here you can choose to dine in the main restaurant area or you can have an al fresco option as well.  My favourite here would have to be the rich marinara pizza which goes perfectly well with the 'PROSCIUTTO & MELONE' (aged ham salad) and a sweet ending of their recommended tiramisu."
0,Sara M.,DuViet,"My second exploration of Vietnamese and it did not fail me. Such a good food, I had an amazing time. I tried the BBQ Lemongrass Chicken Chop compared to last time when I had duck roaster. this was still so good. I had such a blast with friends.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is good, I love the decor and the way the restaurant was designed. The staff are super helpful and kind. just ask for it and they'll help you right away."
0,Clarence J.,DuViet,"Good food, terrible service, at least on the night I was there.  I'd drop this to 1 star because of the service but I do feel like the food was at least enjoyable.  The menu is a good size, with a variety of flavors and serving sizes.  The flavors were very good in everything I tried: a chicken and prawn pho, fried spaghetti with chicken and prawns, and assorted spring rolls, as well as ginger-lemongrass tea.  The prices were also good.

Service-wise...  We arrived at 20:40 on a Sunday to find the restaurant looking like a battle zone, with most tables empty of customers but still covered with used dishes -- it seemed like only 2-3 wait staff were around and must have been hopping to accommodate whatever rush they had recently faced.  Once a table was cleared, we were seated and handed the menu.  The ordering pad was also dropped on the table, along with a pencil, before the host/waiter quickly disappeared.  Perhaps this system of ordering is relatively common here, but I still have not come across it outside of some sushi restaurants -- it would have been useful to be able to confirm with the host/waiter that we understood what was going on but he did not try to say anything at all to us before immediately disappearing.  (Up to that point, he had confirmed the number in our party, two, which was the only word he had said to us.)  After a while, the host/waiter returned, grabbed our order sheet -- crumpling it in his hand as he went -- and left, again without an additional word, although he returned after a couple minutes to ask if we wanted our tea hot or cold (again disappearing without a word as soon as we requested the tea hot).  The food came out around 20:55, and after dropping off the last plate, the host/waiter uttered his final words to us: ""Do you have everything?  Because we are closing soon.""  Closing soon?  What?  The mall was open for another hour.  We thought we had misheard something, or perhaps the mall's closing time was earlier than we thought, or that perhaps something unique was going on -- we hadn't noticed any signs to that effect as we came in -- but there was no chance to ask for clarification or context because he rapidly disappeared again.  So we ate, enjoyed our food, and soon noted that other diners seemed to be being ushered out.  We asked for our check no later than 21:15, and when it was brought out by someone new we were told, ""Because we are closing soon, we can no longer take your credit card.  You will need to pay with cash.""  Again, What??  Irritated at the service and confusion, despite the good food, we dug up the cash and headed out . . . into the mall where _all_ the other restaurants remained open and bustling -- still seating new customers -- and all the stores were still open.  A check of the restaurant's official closing time confirmed that DuViet was not scheduled to close until 22:00.  I assume there was a reason they were closing significantly early -- and a reason they had turned off their credit card machine when customers were still present who had not yet paid -- but it would have helped to let us know about the deadline we were up against, more than the quick comment in passing when dropping off our food.  Also, there were no signs indicating a change in the time, and the door remained wide open when we departed, with the menu on the front podium, and no indication of imminent closure except for the basically empty restaurant.

As I said, I do think the food was enjoyable.  However, because of the service experience, I do not expect that I will return."
0,Tita T.,DuViet,One of the most authentic Vietnamese noodles you can find I kl. Highly recommended is the pho Bo - Hanoi style and the spring rolls
0,Alex R.,DuViet,"I had the vegetarian pho and my husband had a spicy beef pho. Both were so, so good. I haven't eaten a lot of Vietnamese so I don't know what is considered good Vietnamese, but both of these bowls of soup were so good! Mine was savory and mild, filled with rice noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and other veggies. Fresh mint and lime came on the side. So good. I'd go back!"
0,Juan S.,DuViet,"I have the rice roll with pork. It was steaming hot on a bed of bean sprouts. The rice noodle is smooth and silky. I had the Ban Cha noodles. Nice assorted of grilled meat. Flavor of meat is nicely seasoned. Served with rice noodles, lettuce and Thai basil. Finished the meal with drop coffee. Great meal."
0,Michelle C.,Cowboy's Ranch,"Located just opposite Aeon Big in Jalan Peel, Cheras, this western restaurant was empty when the hubby and I dropped by for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. We checked it out purely out of curiosity and was quite pleasantly surprised. They served grilled chicken and steak as well as local favourites like fried rice and noodles. My hubby settled for Penang fried Kuey Teow and I ordered their Rosemary chicken.

They were offering a special promotion of drinks for only RM 1.00 when we were there so I had a cucumber juice and hubby had a glass of iced Melaka coffee. The coffee was not strong but I really loved the cucumber juice as it was very refreshing for a hot day. The food was equally good although the kuey Teow did not taste like authentic Penang style noodles. The Rosemary sauce that came with my chicken was satisfyingly savoury and thick. The chicken came a side of fries, coleslaw and salad. Depending on what day you're there, side dishes can include roasted potatoes too. The server was really friendly and took time out to get feedback on the food and service, which we told him was really good. Our meal came to less than RM25 in total, which is really affordable for western food."
0,Altinay A.,LOKL,"Really solid place for a western fancy breakfast in KL! If you're visiting and want to go to brunch then definitely stop by LOKL. We were immediately seated and received good service from our waiter. We tried the ""big breakfast"" and eggs florentine"". I would suggest getting the big breakfast if you are really hungry because there's a lot of food on that plate. I thoroughly enjoyed my eggs florentine. They were cooked to perfection.

I believe LOKL is connected to a hostel so if you stay here then you will definitely enjoy the service and food. I also walked into the bathroom and was surprised at how clean it was."
0,Caspar G.,LOKL,"Very good space for juices, coffee and breakfast or lunch. Loved my juice and coffee coconut water drink!"
0,Sgvft T.,LOKL,"Coffee good, food OK, fairly expensive for KL. Wifi was awful - slow and cuts out. Can't work here."
0,Rodlie O.,LOKL,"Really enjoyed it. It was a high-quality good-tasting breakfast. Food came quick. And, they open at 8am for breakfast. For Kuala Lumpur that seems to be really early :)"
0,Annabel H.,LOKL,"A very cute place to have a nice lunch or breakfast at, the staff was really sweet and went out of there way for us to make sure we could split the bill. What was also nice is that my friend ordered just a soup and a drink and they added that as an add on so they counted it as a two course meal, what was cheaper than putting the soup and drink on the bill separately. Not a lot of vegetarian options"
0,Jon S.,LOKL,"Good coffee, didn't order food. Service was a little slow but friendly. In a cool neighborhood and the inner atmosphere is solid."
0,Christine S.,LOKL,"This was my favorite breakfast in KL. I had the fluffy pancakes with palm sugar syrup and banana cream and they were soooo good. The texture of the pancakes tastes like it was made of tapioca flour or some other type of flour that made it almost chewy. The nuts added just the right crunchy texture. The iced Kopi-O without sugar was probably the best iced coffee I've ever had. It tastes how cold brew should taste. The brisket hash was not really my favorite, but that's because the bbq type sauce they use doesn't really jive. But overall, everything was good. I loved this place."
0,Karen T.,LOKL,"The only coffee place near the Masjid Jamek area worth going to. The food can be a bit pricey for lunch but the coffee prices are within the average range.

The cakes are pretty nice especially the caramel mille crepe  but the kopi susu isn't what it used to be. My past 2 visits, it has a bit of a burnt after taste.

You must must must try the chicken chop. It's very delicious. I was expecting the usual hainanese chicken chop but was pleasantly surprised with the southern touch ie corn bread, brown gravy and creamed spinach.

They have a pleasant Al fresco area where it's nice to chill out if it's not too crowded or hot."
0,Penny W.,LOKL,"LOKL, pronounced 'Local' indeed has a very unique name. It is situated at Jalan Tun HS Lee. The first time I went there with my friend, it took us almost an hour to find the café. We could have gave up but I guess after walking around the area for so long, we were determined enough to locate that place. It is definitely a place you would very much prefer to use the public transport and walk because there are rarely any parking spot.

In the afternoon, the place is packed and sometimes booked because it is known to serve good brunch food. I personally never tried any of the brunch meals but I've eaten the crème brulee before and it was really yummy! The cappuccino and affogato tasted quite refreshing maybe because we're so tired from walking. The crowd will die down in the evening and the atmosphere is certainly mellower as you can only hear the music and conversations among your friends.

I adore the toilet design as it gives a rustic industrial look and it is kept clean too! The outdoor space is interconnected with BackHome which is a backpackers hostel. So there are usually a few tourists chilling at the outdoor place."
0,Ian L.,LOKL,"The little café exudes an old KL type of cool with Melbourne-style café concept. Décor is minimal with raw brick, peeling wooden tables and pop arts complete the scene.
   Coffee variety runs from Italian to local range. There's also a substantial dessert counter too. Service is very amicable and commendable. Popular amongst backpackers."
0,Fairuz Z.,LOKL,"This place certainly are full of surprises, from their weekly specials menu, to the hidden garden seating. Great place to chill and hangout. If you like your coffee strong, this is the place for you. Unfortunately, there's no parking space available near the cafe. They open everyday, except on Monday. Accept all major credit cards. And kids friendly too."
0,Mark L.,LOKL,"Lovely place for a nice cup of coffee. Their latte is nice but surprisingly their ""kopi susu"" is also very delicious. A great place to chill out especially in the midst of a very busy part of the city. No parking around here so it's best if you are walking. The Masjid Jamek LRT station is nearby."
0,Louise C.,LOKL,"Loving the outdoor area which is perfect for private party. Go for the signature Roast Chicken, Red Velvet Brownie, Salmon Pancake. And the friendly staffs are so welcoming too. Park at the end of the street. Or take the LRT to masjid Jamek station."
0,YongJie L.,LOKL,"LOKL is located in the center of the KL City, along one of the busy street near Masjid Jamek. It is joined together with a backpacker hostel. There were two reasons of why I paid a visit to this restaurant, first is because we were running of lunch venues; second is because we want to look for a place where we can hang out, sit down and enjoy during lunch hour. LOKL seems like a good place to us due to its cool interior and good ambience.

I remembered me and friend ordered a lunch set to share as the price is really not friendly. It came with drink, main course (burger) and a dessert. My comment on the food would be creative but not enjoyable. It tasted a little weird for us. I paid a second visit after the first experience, we were thinking maybe give it a try again to order something to drink instead, we ordered the ice chocolate. Again, disappointed. I never been there after that although i really love the ambience. But it doesn't worth the money at all. Some of my colleagues like their coffee and the waiters are friendly. If you are interested, you may drop by to try it out."
0,Bryan S.,LOKL,"Located in the city center of KL, LOKL has branded itself with the selling point of being truly 'local' with their walls plastered with pictures that each embody various elements of Malaysia, but of course has seen its fair share of globalization with a fusion of western and Malaysian cuisine such as their Hainanese Style meatloaf and standard fare selection of western coffee. If anything impressed me, it was their staff, very friendly and well spoken. The food, eh. Nothing to rave about, Hot chocolate was diluted and the prices aren't driving any budget friendly foodies to surround the place. Overall, it's just another place to get some very decent food."
0,Kimberly X.,LOKL,"LOKL sticks out along the KL streets as its surrounded by mostly hawker stalls. Its probably the only cafe on that street actually. Their food is unpretentious and has a homemade feel to it. The interior of the place is very cosy, warm and inviting. A drastic contrast to its neighbouring stores. Their French toast was really a winner in my book and it was served with thick, chunky slices of read as opposed to the usual thin, ordinary bread slices. For two slices of bread and a banana, it did cost a little bit too much I would say at RM16.90. Probably not an everyday lunch spot if you're working in KL as you'd definitely eat into your salary here. For a more savoury option try their Hainanese Meatloaf with bits of chestnut in it. The surrounding area is a little dodgy so do be aware of your surroundings if you're here late at night."
0,Cher K.,Shin Kee Beef Noodle Specialist,Great beef noodles. I much prefer the dry version over the soup. You can pretty much pick any noodle - but my favourite is the Hakka Lou Shu Fun.
0,Nikki L.,Shin Kee Beef Noodle Specialist,"Simple beef noodle place with the vendor cooking the noodles in front and wooden table and plastic chairs to sit within.

I tried the beef ball noodles which consisted of soft, white noodles layered with minced beef, a sprinkle of green onions, some beef balls, and broth on top. It was decently good.

Easy, quick, and cheap meal - a bowl for 9 ringgit."
0,Michel K.,Malai Thai Cuisine,I was really impressed by the food. I am a big fan of Thai food and they certainly met my expectations! I enjoyed every dish we ordered. And the coconut ice cream is a must.
0,M S M.,Malai Thai Cuisine,"Malai Thai is a great choice for those who enjoy authentic Thai food served in a clean, friendly place at a fair price. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The food flavor and presentation is great. I will visit again and recommend to others. Went back again a few days later to enjoy some of the other items on their menu and was not disappointed. The same delicious food, presented nicely by the attentive staff. Will go there again and try something else."
0,Michelle C.,Penang Xpress,"I was extremely surprised and impressed with this tiny restaurant . I mean, never would I expect that a small stall that has only 5 tables and located in a shopping mall could ever serve good food, but i was really blown away.

The Loh bak here is the best I've tasted i the Klang Valley and their asam laksa is rather generous on the fish taste. Their cendol was refreshingly piled full of goodies. I learnt a really good lesson to not judge a book by its cover"
0,Jia J.,Penang Xpress,"It is a small restaurant found in KL Festival City, it is easily hidden due to its location lies in between a decent Korean restaurant and a Taiwan cuisine restaurant (Shih Lin snack). However, it is not surprising for one to discover Penang Xpress by good smell of its food!

Petite in size, this restaurant can serve up to 20 (approximately) customers at one time. Featuring the famous Malaysian food like Nasi Lemak,  Laksa, Fried Kuey Teow, Malay kuih, you can always curb your hunger for delicious Malaysian food.

I tried both Nasi Lemak with Rendang chicken and Fried Kuey Teow, the taste is excellent. Have no complaint on the taste but the food is slightly overpriced. Ranging from RM7.50 to above RM10 per selection. However, you need to take into account of its location in a shopping mall. You can't demand for price on par with those on street.

Laksa can be better in taste. The soup is not thick enough and as a spicy lover, I crave for laksa soup with fragrance and exciting spicy sensation! But, if you are not a spicy lover, this may be good enough for you.

The restaurant is small in size and the kitchen is situated really close to the dining areas. So, if you dislike getting yourself stained with smell of Malaysian food, you might need a plan B. Else, if you are excited to tell the world that you've been for Malaysian food, by all means, savour the great taste of Penang Xpress."
0,Hazriq I.,Yong Tau Foo Kg Pandan,"Wow! Love this place. Trust me, you wont be disappointed with the food.

Their Yong Tau Foo is marvelous! I would prefer the yong to be in the soup! You can request for that.

To eat:
1. Self pick your yong tau foo.
2. Queue your plate.
3. Move back from the food table. Let others pick their item.
4. Wait.
5. When your turn is up, tell the lady how many yong do you want. And either you want to mix the gravy or put it in a soup.
6. Eat it!

For dessert, their durian crepe is not that bad - a bit pricey though."
0,Mimi H.,Yong Tau Foo Kg Pandan,"I grew up with this Yong tau foo, and i know none places which has tasty,full of flavor and delicious yong tau foo  like this! I am not sure about the restaurant's name because they are so famous - and they dont have any shop's name in front of the restaurant. I am certain this shop has start operated since 20+  years ago.

he restaurant famously know as the best yong tau foo in Kampung Pandan, It can be found easily if you know Kampung Pandan area. If you know location of Restoran Kari Kepala Ikan Kampung Pandan, just straight until you see the shop- Purple color.  Parking is not available here, you need to park at the road shoulder nearest the restaurant ( Please be aware that the road is so narrow and it is in resident area)

Usually, i came here for take away only - since the restaurant are kinda crowded and full every time i came. Anyway, this restaurant practiced self-service, so just pick any ingredients you want (you can take the boiled ingredients too!). There is a lot of ingredients which i can think you can get anything you want to be in your yummy Yong Tau Foo.

I think, what made the restaurant so famous ever since i am kid is... the sauce -  chilli sauce and soy sauce ( i am not sure if that's what people called it so i named it hihi) The sauce has its own taste that i rarely found in any other yong tau foo i had tried. The sauce is so thick and not too sweet ( soy sauce) and not too spicy for chilli sauce. You can request for the soup if you want it ( yes, it is a must for me!)

Beside famous with it Yong Tau Foo, the restaurant also famous with its  Mee rebus-which is taste like real mee rebus i ever had. The gravy is so good and fulfilling. Another menu worth to try is- Durian Belanda. Sweet and it is not just a water but  also juicy and have bits of pulp. Yummmeyhhhh !"
0,Zilin C.,Mum's Place,"SO AMAZING.

Everything stood out for me. From the ambience to the decor, the food and service quality. I can't find a better place that serves such delicious meals in the area.
Decor was old school Portugese style with a fancy heavy metal door and old school wooden tables and chairs.
Went with 3 other friends and we were greeted with warm smiles and shown immediately to an empty table (didn't have to make a reservation; but highly recommend it especially on the weekends as it gets very packed and you might have to wait a while before getting a table).We ordered the butter sauce soft shell crab, spicy fish head curry and Portugese chicken devil curry, which is their house specialty and which will blow your mind away.
Reasonably priced. For the 4 of us, the total cost of the bill came to slightly more than 150RM, including drinks and dessert (the Red Bean Cendol added a final touch to our meals and satisfied our full bellies). Food came relatively quick despite the busy kitchen (for some reason the place got more packed after we arrived).
The only downside I can think of is that most of their dishes are spicy, so you will need to be able to have some level of tolerance for spicy foods to be able to enjoy your meals at Mum's place. Also family friendly - saw quite a number of bigger families with young kids and babies.
Highly recommend Mum's place if you're in the area; even if you're not - it's well worth the trip!"
0,Sangeetha M.,Mum's Place,"Good bang for your buck. Great atmosphere. It has homely vibes, and at the same time very laidback because of all the funny posters and decor the have on the walls. I could spend ages reading all of them.

Easy to find, and parking isn't bad. Their spicy dishes are very spicy! Menu has a lot of options. Their service is very slow and had to flag down people to help us. Other than that, I have no complaints.

I recommend the mum's favourite terung black pepper."
0,Shearlee L.,Mum's Place,"Having previously date a Portuguese guy from the Portuguese Settlement in Melaka before, I am relatively familiar with their dishes and am a huge fan of their food. Like a big big fan.

Coming here for the first time, I was amazed with how big this 6 shop-lot Restaurant-boutique is! Food here is Halal and they serve local Malaysian food and Portuguese cuisine in a rather tropical setting, wooden features and decorations, almost Balinese I thought. I really liked the many witty and cool some vintage signage that is randomly hung around the entire place, allowing a chuckle or two as you glance around.

Apparently, their dishes are cooked in cholesterol-free palm oil. The menu consists of a variety of dishes, especially catering to spicy food lovers. Not wanting to over-indulge because it was rather late for our usual dinner time, we only tried a few dishes. Everything was Okay, they were tasty but it terms of authenticity, it wasn't too close to how I've grown accustomed to. The Fried Cencaru Chilli Padi Fish was nice and really spicy, but the chilli padi paste lacked something I could not put my finger to! But then again, I came to learn that every family in the settlement has their own style of cooking as well so I guess it's now rather ambiguous. I thought the vegetable portions could be a little bigger, considering they are about RM14. You can ask for some cucumber slices and belacan as appetizers.

A little pricey for local food but I think the ambiance really is quite lovely. Nice to go for a casual date or family dinner!

They have a break and are closed from 3pm and re-opens at about 6pm."
0,Jen L.,Mum's Place,"Looking for a new adventure of home recipe's of home cook food and new adventure to trigger your taste buds on something more different? This place brings you Portuguese Cuisines.

It will be very full during festivals so you need to book beforehand, service is quick and alert. Around you will be furniture's such as shelf, paintings, wood carvings for sale and on walls are VIP's such as prime ministers, famous athletes who came here to eat before.

Order whatever dish in the menu because everything is delicious, bursting with unique flavors and  do not break a sweat when it comes to eating their signature curry dish."
0,Melanie C.,Mum's Place,"Just after our shopping trip, we are in for another treat and this time it is dinner at Mum's Place. Mum's Place brings out the best of Malaysian and local Portuguese cuisine while being inspired by traditional home recipes. With plenty of wooden furniture, wooden statues, carvings and fancy screens, it makes a comfortable setting at Mum's Place. Don't forget to check our some of the signs and quotes too, I guarantee you will giggle or smile at some of them. To get the best out of Mum's Place it is recommended to share dishes around the table. So grab your friends and family and go have a feast!

To start, we had some Otak-otak cubes served with Thai sauce (RM16.90). The Otak-otak cubes makes a great starter as they are tasty and addictive. The plus of this dish is the bite sized cubes of the Otak-otak, which is also great for a snack! YUM!

During every visit to Mum's Place, the Cencaru Fish with Chili Padi Paste and Petai (RM19.90 for 2 fishes and an extra for RM9.95) dish is a must order for us. If you are a petai enthusiast and your tolerance level of chili is high, this dish is your best friend. Yes it is delicious but I warn you that you may spit fire after eating this fish. Not for the faint hearted.

We had the Chicken Pong Teh with Sauce (RM16.80). Chicken Pong Teh is a traditional 'Nyonya' chicken dish with soya sauce, potatoes & black mushroom. Compared to the Cencaru Fish, this dish is not spicy but it will sure tantalise your tastebuds. One of my favourites.

To balance the mains we had, it is essential to order some vegetables. We had the Daun Keledek (Sweet Potato Leaves) with Lime Juice, Dried Shrimps and Chili Padi Paste (RM13.90). Although there is Chili Padi, this dish is mildly spicy. With a combination of lime juice and dried shrimps added to the sweet potato leaves, this enhances the fresh flavours and the sweetness of the dish.

We also ordered the Steamed Beancurd (Tofu) with Minced Chicken and Gravy (RM13.90). Drenched in the gravy and minced chicken, the beancurd was perfectly steamed and it was smooth and silky. The dish was full of flavour.

We did not have any dessert to finish but I am sure there is always a next time! If you are at Mum's Place, please do check out some of their desserts too. Some of the desserts offered at Mum's Place are ABC (Ice Kacang), Cendol with Red Beans, Pulut Tekan with Kaya and other traditional desserts.

Mum's Place is another restaurant that my family and I have always come back to every trip back to KL. Highly recommended if you love spicy food. For those whose tolerance of chili is not that high, don't worry, Mum's Place also offers dishes which are not spicy to mildly spicy. Mum's Place is the place to be for all."
0,Joni C.,Mum's Place,"Rarely can you find a restaurant that serves good Portugese and Malaysian fusion food outside of Melaka. At Mum's Place, you have a variety of seafood, chicken, beef and vegetable dishes to choose from, and best of all, they are Halal. Hence, it makes for the perfect place to organise a get-together.

Most of the dishes contain sambal, so it's definitely a spicy feast that typical Malaysian taste buds know and love. Seafood lovers must try the fish dishes! The prices are on the higher side; expect to pay more than RM30 per person, but it is totally worth it if you go in a big group where you can order a few dishes to share with rice.

The restaurant was actually expanded from an oriental antique furniture store. So, there were some pieces of sculptures and furniture that are up for sale on display around the dining area. It actually adds on to the exotic ambience."
0,Andy L.,Mum's Place,"Mum's Place is quite literally your mum's place; old, rustic and the food incredibly good.

Portuguese food is what they offer, and at a reasonable price too. Try their devil's curry based dishes, for it is spicy, savory and luscious all into one. No one can expect that much from a restaurant whose name sounds like the kind that you would name when you are drunk from too much cocktails of different assortments. Of course, their seafood tastes good too, and their signature Portuguese beef based dishes are renowned to taste like a slice of heaven too.

That being said, I will come back here again, this time with more friends, possibly because I want to share my love of curry a little bit more. Ta ta."
0,Grace N.,Mum's Place,"A very good and comfy place to go to for something closest to a home-cooked meal. It's a great place for families to dine at, a wide selection of dishes to pick from which are of a fusion of Portugese, Chinese, Malay, and a little Nyonya influence too. Recommended is the deep fried butter soft shell crab served on a plate of salad. Besides that, the mutton curry is also worth trying. The curry is thick, smooth and absolutely fragrant and is loaded with curry leaves and santan, while the potatoes are soft and mutton tender and succulent. Desserts are nice too especially the dyed pulut tekan served with kaya dip."
0,Ariel L.,JP Teres,"A very good place to taste authentic Malay food! Service is quick and friendly. We were blessed to have Sous Chef Sanjay Singh Parihar to explain our meal and made the experience a lot more enjoyable since my wife likes to cook (I just like to eat but she is a chef herself) and they started talking about how the food was prepared so it made knowing how the food was cooked all the more enjoyable.

Why not give 5 stars? No chocolate dessert! Well technically there's a whole cake you can buy but it's not sold by the slice! Bummer!

It's also walking distance from the twin petronas towers so if you want to avoid the huge crowds, this is a nice quiet place to enjoy a very good meal."
0,Nurul Z.,JP Teres,"I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars and that itself is generous.

I went here for dinner with my family, and it is purely based on some good reviews we've read about online and from friends. Unfortunately, we left feeling a bit disappointed... and a little cheated.

The menu at JP Teres is not unique, in fact you can find most if not all of the food listed at any other streetside restaurant in KL/Selangor, but they charge these food for premium prices.

I don't actually mind the price, if the food is worth the money I'm paying... and unfortunately it was not. Almost everything all of us ordered was sub-par and mediocre. In fact, we've had better versions of all the dishes we ordered for a lot cheaper someplace else a lot less fancier.

The cheese naan was good - and was the only thing I genuinely enjoyed. But the nasi ayam (chicken rice) here does not stand up to its hype. The thali set was disappointing. The mango sticky rice dessert had a poor glutinous rice to mango ratio, and mangoes used were of a lower grade despite its exorbitant price. The drinks were average in every which way possible.

And for that this restaurant deserves no praise for its food.

However, the service here is great and I have no complaints. The waiters attend to your needs and are soft-spoken and polite. However if I could recommend one thing (service-wise) to improve on is the time taken for the food ordered to be served.

My family of 9 came in for dinner, and it took long enough to notice until the food arrives. One thing I didn't like other than that was the fact that the food wasn't delivered all at once. I always think that restaurants should serve everyone on the same table at around the same time, so that no one person has to eat first or counting the seconds till their food arrives."
0,Vanessa O.,JP Teres,"Located at Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur, JP Teres is one of the dining areas for those who stay in the hotel. It is at the ground floor relatively near to the entrance of the hotel. This place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Getting here is not difficult, you can alight Raja Chulan Monorail and use the connection bridge and walk towards KLCC. Grand Hyatt Hotel is beside KLCC. Or simply use the KLCC LRT station to come here.

JP Teres offers extremely stylish contemporary settings that have both indoors and outdoors as well as an open kitchen - which is common for you to see this style in Grand Hyatt. The interior is absolutely fantastic and definitely one of the trendiest café in Kuala Lumpur. They also offer outdoor bar / alfresco terrace dining area. Staffs arewere extremely friendly and relatively prompt in serving to your needs. If you needed recommendation for food, the staffs are more than happy to introduce their best sellers.

They have a variety of Asian fusion food which is fancy and delicious! Bring your expat friends here to enjoy the upscale Asian food that you can find almost everywhere in Malaysia and dine in a comfortable environment :)

A good place for you to enjoy Malaysian food on an upscale environment!"
0,DD C.,Grand Imperial Seafood HotPot & BBQ,"We were overwhelmed by the restaurant's cordial, pleasant, warm service. The 5 star rating said something more about the service than the food. This new restaurant was situated on the 9 floor of the Pavilion Elite, a unique location: quiet and exclusive.

We ordered La Main Soup with Beef Cube (紅燒牛肉手拉麵 $5.70; well prepared; beef was soft and juicy; noodles' chewy but flavorsome. Excellent.); La Mian Soup with Peanut Paste (四川擔擔手拉麵 $3.30; another success: classic flavor and ""hot""; noodles: chewy) and ¼ portion of  London Cherry Duck (燒烤倫敦櫻桃鴨; $8.40. succulent!)

We loved this place."
0,DD C.,Pho Vietz,"It's odd that we were here for Vietnamese foods instead of Malaysian's specialty.
We first had a Vietnam Atiso Tea ($3.50, flavorsome). Then we commanded Tiger Prawn Roll ($2.50, classic); 4-Beef Combo Noodle Soup ($4.90, luscious); and Vietnam Pan Cake ($3.80, interesting stuff but quite delicious).
The restaurant decorated in a unique and amiable way. The ""bamboo trees"" were its showcase. The restaurant in general was clean, airy, and illuminated."
0,Su Zanne C.,Big Bowl,"True Malaysians will eat (or try to) their food spicy even if it's going to cause sweat dripping down their necks and mucus coming out of their nose. Yeah, we know it's not a pretty sight, but we'd still do it if it's worth it, and Big Bowl's worth it.

Their signature curry noodle/laksa is some fragant creamy goodness with chicken and plenty of tau foo pok. Nothing's better than having a soaked tau foo pok, equivalent to a mini curry bomb, in your mouth. You would want that because the curry is delicious. I could drink off the entire bowl until it's dry.

As the name says it all - their noodles are all served in a big bowl, and the bowl does not lie. Their portion is BIG."
0,Vanessa W.,Big Bowl,"This shop is quite famous in yulek. Their signature food is their curry laksa ! they are also selling chicken floss noodles , loh mee and more . But I like their curry noodle the most !
Although it is called as curry noodles but the curry is actually not that spicy . The soup is really delicious . The noodles are serves in a big bowl and the portions is huge ! It is very cheap it only cost RM7+ for a bowl of laksa ."
0,Alfie C.,Auntie Lora Kopitiam,"I am a big fan of Prawn Mee and I know how to determine the best one. The one at Auntie Lora Kopitiam is one of the best.

The noodle was perfect. Not dry like most other noodle joints and the flavor of the prawn was so rich. Plus, it quite generous with the fillings. All of that just inside a bowl of Prawn Mee. I don't have to describe about the curry. Just look at he photo and you will know how good it is."
0,Nicole S.,Italiannies,"I haven't been to the Italiannies outlet here for a good three to four years now, and finally revisited them when I went out to dinner with my parents. We were greeted warmly by the hostess, and brought to a booth in the middle of the restaurant. The first thing I noticed about the place is the warm lighting and how crowded it was. The place was absolutely packed with people, with barely any empty tables. Unfortunately, this also meant that the restaurant was rather noisy, but not so unbearable.

As always, our server brought us the complimentary bread, which is meant to be had with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We took quite some time to pour over the menu, and our server was on hand to offer clarifications and suggestions. A lot of the dishes on the menu contained beef, which could be limiting for some people.
We ordered the Barbeque Smoked Duck pizza (RM35.90). Pizzas here are thin crust and measure 12"" across, except for the Pizza Enorme which comes in a 16"" size. The Barbeque Smoked Duck features smoked duck breast with a thin layer of fat, peaches, sliced red onion, chilli flakes, arugula, and mozzarella cheese with a barbeque sauce base. The smoked duck was tender, which was a welcome surprise as breast meat usually comes out overcooked and hard. Perhaps the layer of fat helped keep the moisture in. The peaches weren't overly sweet, but brought a nice balance between the flavours of the pizza. Each bite was a medley of smokey and sweet, with hints of bitterness brought on by the arugula.

We ordered the Lasagna A La Ravina (RM35.90), but swapped it out for chicken lasagna. I didn't expect much, honestly, and was subsequently blown away. This was hands down the best chicken lasagna I have ever had. It was cheesy and gooey and warm and essentially, comfort food at its best. I only wish they had given more of the marinara sauce, as it helped cut down the ""jelak"" factor of the cheese."
0,Susan K.,Italiannies,"Visiting my sister and her family in KL and thought we'd try some Italian. The prices seemed reasonable. It's listed as a $$$, but that's relative considering food in KL is so inexpensive compared to Nor Cal prices. The bill was about RM225 (less than $60 USD!) for four adults and three kids. (Kids eat free with each paid entree).

We stuck with comfort Italian foods and ordered family style: Enorme pizza (sampler of Hawaiian, roasted garlic, shrimp with mushroom, and pepperoni), a lasagna bolognese and spaghetti & meatballs. The kids got spaghetti marinara, chicken strips and Margherita pizza. The food was really good and tasted pretty authentic (with the substitute of chicken for most pork products here in Malaysia). We also ordered smoothies (pineapple-mango and strawberry) and bottled water (they offer three kinds: San Pelligrino, Aqua Panna and Blue Minerale).

Overall, it was a really great dining experience. Oh and apparently, you can get it delivered through food panda (kinda like DoorDash). Yum!"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Italiannies,"Always been one of my favourite italian restaurants in town, italiannies offer good pizza, pasta, salad and even tiramisu.

Only visiting for the first time after their renovation,  their new restaurant now does not have the window view anymore. However, this newly renovated place is more dimmed and has more of the ambience of a fine dining place.

I've tried their crusted fish with rice this time - fish is good and the rice too.

However, their mussels cooked in fresh herbs isn't really meeting my expectations, it made me miss those good mussels that i have had in the u.k. so much nostalgic.

Prices here are the usual good restaurant charges, not cheap but for their food here i think its worth the price.
Their pasta and other dishes here are good for sharing and in fact they do give options of portions which are for you to share.

Overall, great place good food fair price - surely coming back again when craving for italians."
0,Diviyah G.,Italiannies,"Italiannes is one of my favourite restaurants to go to. Its located in Gardens and the newly renovated unit is a little smaller than the previous one. Nevertheless, the taste and quality of the food is excellent. Every time I go there, I come out with a satisfied tummy. This is because, the taste and presentation of their dishes are excellent. For a starter, you should definitely try the Sicilian Chicken salad. Its made up of marinated chicken, mango,red grapes and walnuts all tossed in a Sicilian dressing over fresh romaine lettuce  (Regular 30.90 Abbondanza 40.90). I never would have imagined how mango, raisins and walnut will go well with chicken, but it honestly is the best salad I have ever tasted. Their stuffed mushrooms (Regular 26.90 Abbondanza 35.90) is also quite delicious.

As an Italian restaurant, their pasta game is on point ! They have perfectly cooked pasts with awesome sauce to go with it. You should also give their Barbecue Smoked Duck Pizza ago. This pizza has duck and peaches on it and its a combination that I never imagine would work, but it does! The waiters are also very enthusiastic and fun. The ambience is very romantic and calming too! If you're looking for good Italian food, you should check this place out!"
0,Julian T.,Italiannies,"Another italian craving satisfied! Known for their large servings, sometimes even a problem for my monstrous stomach. The restaurant is dimly lit, giving off a romantic vibe.

The staff kindly showed us to our table where we are served with some bread and a mixture of olive oil and vinegar (I think). All their bread and pizza are made freshly with their oven that gives off a bakery smell if sat near enough.

We ordered a plate of Stuffed Mushroom which is so far my favourite appetizer. It's mushroom stuffed with minced meat, tomatoes, and drenched with a 3 cheese sauce. For our mains, we had a Meatball Bolognese and a Shrimp & Asparagus Alfredo. The size of each dishes was definitely worth the price you pay. The meatballs were HUMONGOUS. The Alfredo was perfectly made, man do I love the teamwork of creamy sauces with Fettucine.

Two mains and an appetizer makes about RM100, do note that we ordered both in the big size. I'll definitely come back more often."
0,Senthil K.,Italiannies,"This place got closed by the time i could write a review !! I'm starting to see a trend in restaurants in Malaysia now. Good food, little pricey if they are in big malls, service is lackluster, and portions are small."
0,Stephanie X.,Italiannies,"The 'modern & inventive' Italian menu here offers a fairly large selection of appetizers, soups, pastas, pizzas, seafood & roast meat for almost everyone's taste buds. However that's not the only thing which is large here. All their serving portions are huge so you definitely would want to share a meal & not let it go to waste.

All Italiannies restaurants present a rather cozy & elegant interior giving  you a rustic Italian feel with the instrumental tunes played in the background. Coupled with warm lightnings & at times a good view this place can be quite suitable for a cosy dinner. I didn't come across any newsletter or post on them having any in house bands however I do recall dining at the Italiannes in Empire where they had a jazz band perform during dinner & it was delightful!

The drinks here are pretty good as well, they have a fine selection of wines to accompany your mains & a detailed cocktail list which might tickle your taste buds!"
0,Su Zanne C.,Italiannies,"Have to give it to them for serving really good Italian food. The moment I walked in, I already love the dim lit dinner like interior! Can I say, I love their free bread with olive oil and vinegar? 'Cause I do. I often have to refrain myself eating too many so that I can enjoy my actual starter and main meal.

For starters, my favourite is the Spinach and Artichoke Formaggio and the Toasted Bruschetta. The garlic dipped in creamy cheese and sundried tomatoes are nothing short of being the perfect combination. If you don't feel like having some cheese, get the Bruschetta. It's like spring bursting in your mouth because the diced tomatoes are fresh!

As for pasta, I've tried the Angel Hair Pomodoro. Angel Hair pasta are very thin and tend to stick together, causing the pasta to be a bit on the mushy side.

As for what size to order, a Piccolo would be sufficient if you're going to get some starters or dessert, or unless you're a small eater. If not, get the regular."
0,Kevin W.,Italiannies,"Pasta! I love pasta, all kinds of pasta! I was craving for some the other day and wanted to spoil myself after long day at work.

I decided to drop by the Gardens, Mid Valley on the way back from work to avoid the jam also knowing that there's an Italiannes.

Once I got there, I did not have to wait for a table and was immediately seated.

I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, the regular portion. Mind you, I did not expect to be served two huge meatballs and a rather large portion of spaghetti.

I was surprised to see the amount but it took as a challenge to finish them all!

It was tough, I must say. I was greedy on the complimentary bread and asked for more. I guess that was my downfall to not be able to finish my main.

The service was pretty decent as the waiters were attentive except for one of them. She ignored my signals as I wanted refill my drink and took forever to return with my drink. Then I tried to avoid her at all cost as I felt she's wasn't attentive or bothered to do her job well.

One sore thumb wouldn't stick out so much for me but I hope that waitress would look back and improve to provide a better and hospitable service."
0,Marcus T.,Italiannies,The thing I love most about this place is that it feels like home. The portion sizes are wonderful. The rustic feel just puts one at ease whenever they step into this store. If you are looking for good Italian food in mid Valley you must go here
0,Ian L.,Market Place,"The 'meat' market is where the LGBT's crowd comes out to play every Saturday.
Dance floor is usually packed with shirtless, buff man boggying to Top 40 remixes.
   If dancing is not your thing, at the roof top bar, you can easily strike a convo with strangers while getting a glimpse of Twin Towers. Either way, a night out to Market Place is always fabulous."
0,Vivian Y.,Market Place,"Market place on saturdays is pretty much gay nights, it's pretty cool. I had a great time when I was there. I haven't been there on other nights but it sure was one heck of an experience. It was super crowded, they play the usual clubbing music. There is a rooftop where you're welcome to have some fresh air. There isn't much standing tables in the place but there are a couple in front of the bar at the side of the stage. The stage resembles the stage at Lust club in Changkat where it was high ceilings and a pretty decent dance floor. The dj deck overlooking the dance floor.

Market place is also pretty decent for its drinks, it costs about the same or cheaper as the bars you would visit in Changkat. There is a huge parking space in front of Market Place so parking isn't a problem at all."
0,Kevin W.,Porridge Stall,"Of late, porridge has been a crave for me. I would look for porridge at least once or twice a week. Something that makes me happy and especially on a rainy day, it is the bomb to have a bowl of hot porridge.

One of my favourite place is the porridge stall on Jalan Midah Besar in Taman Midah, Cheras. My fiance who resides in Cheras was the one who first brought me to the stall. It was love at first spoon. I like the pork mixed part porridge. It is superb and the portion they give is more than enough. And it will cost less than RM10!

At the same time, they do serve other types of porridge and even steam chicken. You can actually order pepper pork intestines soup which is connected to the porridge stall if you're up for it."
0,Everlyn L.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"Bee Won is located at Level 1 of the shopping mall, next to Chatime and opposite Sakae Sushi. It is owned by a Korean uncle who is good in traditional Korean cuisines. It also has another branch in Ampang.

This is so far my most favourite Korean restaurant for so many reasons! The environment is spacious and cozy, ample parking spaces, foods tastes good with cheap prices (without any tax) in which 1 set meal with side dishes can costs just RM 15. My must order lists include its bulgogi that cook in front of guests, with beef, mushrooms, spring onions, glass noodles and a sweet sauce. And I have to mention that its kimchi and kimchi soup taste reallyyyy good!

Side dishes can be refilled with no limit once u order a BBQ set, while water is unlimited refill and free-of-charge. Card payment is accepted here with Korean candy served at the cashier counter. The service is intimate which feels just like your neighbour's house!"
0,Jonathon H.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"Best Korean in Malaysia, bar none. The older couple who own it are lovely people and the lady makes her own Kim Chi, which is probably one of the best I've tasted after living in Seoul for six months. Good price, side dish keeps flowing, and the staff went out of their way to make sure our kids were happy and catered for. Must go."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"Really really good!! Coming back here for times now and you get cheap and proper korean food here. The owners are korean so you don't get nonsense korean-like food here.

Its usually packed here during lunch and dinner hours especially during weekends, so be prepared to get into the waiting list if you're visiting at those hours too.

I like their beef sets the most, which they have barbeque, sweet grilled and other methods of preparations. What's good is you can actually spend less than rm20 to get really satisfied here.

Their banchan (side dishes) here are not bad either, not some lousy quality ones.

Besides, it's quite easy to get a parking here too, except for weekends, again, the mall is really packed. I guess to avoid disappointment by the crowd you should plan ahead before coming."
0,Stephen L.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"This is my favorite Korean restaurant. I was introduced by my  son, Victor Liu, 3 years. Since then, it is our family regular restaurant. I love the Chicken Jung Sik and Beef Jung Sik. I love all the spread of fruits salad, green fresh,  Lettuce and kimchi. I love the kimchi very much and I normally ask for another serving. The staff are very friendly and fast service. The  Burmese staff, Alroi is very train and provide good service. We always have the friendly boss, Mr Son Byung Ho to serve us and introduce the Favorite Korean cuisine. The best of all is that is reasonable price without service charge."
0,Eveline L.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"I've came here twice for its reasonable priced Korean food. Busy during lunch and dinner, you might have to wait for a table if you're unlucky. Service might be a little slow if they're packed.

I love the bbq pork belly as well as their bibimbap. Side dishes are also delicious and best of all, free flow."
0,Siz L.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"Remember to mix the bimbimbup with the restaurant  homemade spicy sauce, or else the owner will come and give you warm hospitality (demonstrate the mixing method!). Tip: add the side dish kimchi to the bimbimbup before mixing, taste great!"
0,Josephine N.,Bee Won Korean BBQ Restaurant,"This place serves great home-cooked korean food! When I'm here, I always go for their Beef Kimchi Soup and it satisfies me all the time. The owners is a Korean couple and they're really passionate with what they serve."
0,Elvi T.,BRYCG,"Great, unique restaurant in KL with solid food and a lovely atmosphere.

Came here for lunch with the fam and we got a burger, the Nashville hot chicken, nachos, the cuban sandwich, and some chicken wings. The hot chicken is SPICY, so don't get it unless you can handle spicy. The cuban sandwich didn't taste cuban, but was still delicious. Wish i could have tried the fried chicken red velvet waffle, but it's only available on weekends.

Service is quick and attentive."
0,Novi N.,BRYCG,"A relatively new, clean and cute spot located right next to the Gleneagles hospital.  BRYCG is located on the 2nd floor.

Food:
Clam chowder | It may possibly be the best clam chowder I've ever had, so if you have the chance, TRY IT OUT!
Jambalaya | I felt that it lacked flavor and I was unable to eat it because it was too spicy.  (Maybe there was too much spice)
Nachos  | Flavorful and extremely cheesy.  It's a great appetizer to share with the table.

Service:
Quick, friendly and super helpful.  

I would definitely recommend trying the place out if you're around the area."
0,Fukumi B.,BRYCG,"Considering there aren't many promising Tex-Mex/Cajun&Creole food options in KL, BRYCG is a solid choice. As long as you come in with zero expectations and your tastebuds have forgotten the taste of good tacos.

From my experience, the waiters there are very friendly but have very little knowledge on what's on the menu/the cuisine they're serving so I would google what you think you'd like to order before actually placing the order.

There's a good variety of options at BRYCG (I think it's pronounced like ""bridge""?). I did see online that they're advertising themselves as a ""New Orleans cuisine"" restaurant but don't expect too much. BRYCG suffers from the typical inability of people to distinguish between different foreign cuisines.

The nachos were meh, the burger was kinda gross, the fajitas were way too spicy, but the basil pesto was good! Seeing as basil pesto pasta isn't exactly texmex, cajun, or creole, though, I really am not sure if this is a compliment. Shoutout to the bread served here, though. Fantastic bread, even the burger bun was great.

The ambience is very nice here. This entire building, really, boasts a stellar atmosphere. Very clean, crisp, and mellow.

I still think this place has a tonne of potential, despite their hard shell tacos tsk tsk, and think with a little more thoughtfulness in the cooking, it could really turn into something great."
0,Tess L.,BRYCG,"Disappointing. This is the kind of place you'd visit ONCE.
Waited 40mins for Chicken and red velvet waffle. The only thing red about the waffle was the colour. It was dry, lacked favour and was heavily coated in icing sugar. Drumsticks coating was slightly burnt & inside was undercooked."
0,Sin Yee Y.,The Humble Chef,"Another well-known restaurant that almost every HELP student know about. Humble Chef initially did their business in a food truck, which they sell food at the roadside near Jalan Damansara Heights. 2 years ago, they finally opened up a physical restaurant at Plaza Damansara, still, they didn't stop operating their food truck. But now, they have extended their business hour. With only food truck, Humble Chef only start their business at 9pm; however, their physical restaurant is opening in the morning until night.

Humble Chef is selling pasta, omelet and pita, with 3 different ingredients - lamb, chicken and beef. All food are delicious and guess what? The price range is between RM2.50 to RM5! YES, I am not kidding! Tell me where you can find such cheap food in Klang Valley in the current era?

I normally order a chicken olio pasta and a chicken omelet since I don't eat lamb and beef. With such cheap price, they serve customers with big plate and also lot of chicken slice. The omelet isn't like what we always eat at restaurant, chicken/lamb/beef were added into the omelet with mayonnaise sauce in. So, when biting it, you can feel the mayonnaise is coming out from the inner layer.

Till now, I still go there often, just to crave for the delicious pasta. If you are around KL, don't forget to try Humble Chef. Food are cheap and delicious."
0,Julian T.,The Humble Chef,"Today, on cheap eats- we talk about Humble Chef!

Humble Chef has truly earned a place in my heart. They have the cheapest pasta and other distinct snacks. Only RM5 for all their different types of pasta and the best part is, they're all amazingly delicious. They have four main signatures- Olio, Bolognese, Carbonara, and Pesto. All are available in your choice of meat. I highly recommend the Lamb Olio and Bolognese (just talking about this makes me salivate). Aside from the pasta, they also have Fried Laksa here, which again, is amazingly delicious. If you want to divert from the usual pasta, try this and you will not regret.

They also have Omelettes and Pitas here, which are only RM2.50 and RM4 respectively. I highly recommend trying both of these as well. Depending on the time you visit, its always almost fully packed and you have to kinda queue. But no worries, after trying it once, you could go on a Humble Chef diet for weeks.

P.S.- They also have a food truck around 9pm in front of the HELP Residence.

And that concludes today's episode of cheap eats."
0,Vivian Y.,The Humble Chef,"Humble chef is pretty famous. It used to be a food truck way back when and this is the first restaurant that they opened after a couple of years. My favorite dish is the grilled chicken with pasta. It's absolutely delicious, it's pricier than the typical pasta portions in the restaurant. Humble chef has it's regulars, mainly it's very full during dinner times.

Parking can be a little of a hassle because there are many other little shops and cafes running around that row of shops. There are also a couple of banks around the area as well."
0,Syamin I.,The Humble Chef,"Cheap Cheap and cheap!!! It is suitable with the restaurant name (HUMBLE CAFE). Let me ask you, can you get a plate with pasta, omelette at RM5? Here it is the place where when you want to save your money or not enough budget but you want western foods like pasta, pitas and etc.

Humble Cafe have operating a van stall or mobile truck before until they got to open a CAFE. see it's really really successful. They have a very simple cafe and menu with simple design and art in the cafe. what you can see a square tables and also the chairs.

The cafe fulled with HELP students which is nearby and also the office workers during the peak hours. I came here during the dinner time. They only selled 3 types of drinks which is lychee, ice lemon tea and also soya bean for RM1.50. see it's really simple yet very enjoyable to hang around with your friends here."
0,Andy L.,The Humble Chef,"Humble Chef is well reputed to be both humble in their service and their price, with their chefs serving humble sized portions for the hungry kids that hail from the universities nearby.

The best thing to eat there are really the pastas, with the carbonara being the wisest choice of them all. The well cooked pasta compliments well with the white sauce that is coupled with ham and various other ingredients that will just make you wanting for more. With the price being pretty humble as well, it comes as no surprise that students around that area are starting to get a little... Thick boned than they used to be.

I kid, I kid. If you are afraid of getting a little abnormally sized, I suggest that you do not step in into this restaurant at all. You will never, ever, not order anything here, and never ever, not get your stomachs filled with sauce-y goodness, I can vouch for sure."
0,Saiful B.,The Humble Chef,"So a group of HELP seniors including myself went to visit our University. After the long walk, from each department to our previous classroom venues, we got hungry. Knowing some of us, we always used to hang out at Humble Chef after classes or during lunch break.

Up the hill we went and into the store to order ourselves spaghetti carbonara. For a affordable price, the carbonara tastes like the days where we used to eat it. Though the portion is a little small, but its value for money. Knowing us, we always go for 2 portion each!

Yes, if you are new to HELP or finding a budget eating place, Humble Chef is just around the corner!"
0,Jen L.,The Humble Chef,"A very small yet artsy place situated in Damansara as there are not many hipster cafe's around here,

The have an interesting menu and very affordable! Lamb Pita (RM5) & Chicken and mozarella cheese Omelette (RM5) , Seafood Aglio Olio (RM5), Looks small portion but it is actually medium size.

I really love the cozyness here and the friendly service. The food came fast and the environment and the music made my butt stick here like a glue."
0,Onn Rei T.,Jarrod & Rawlins,"It was Sunday and I slept in. Woke up way too close for lunch so, spoke to my loving God mom and decided to get us some Sunday Roast! I haven't have that since returning from UK. This is located in Bangsar, between BSC & Bangsar Village. Great place to go for brunch or lunch just before you start your day of shopping!

Ambience - it reminds me of the pubs that I used to go to for dinners while I was studying abroad. It has a few tables, a bar in the middle. They do serve alcohol & pork here. It is a very relaxed ambience if it were a Sunday afternoon but it can get more interesting during happy hour. It is good for small groups around 6-8 or a small family meet up. Do call up for reservations. It can be a great place for couple's brunch as their food portion can be a little too much for small eaters to finish.

Food - I tried the Sunday roast (everything; chicken, pork, beef, Yorkshire pudding & some vegetables to make you feel less guilty). The beef slice was perfectly cooked to medium, beautifully pink in the center, tender & juicy. The chicken breast was juicy, well seasoned, right amount of flavour in it. Of course the salty sauce for Sunday roast that was to be honest was a little too salty for me. But definitely full of flavour.

The Sunday Roast will cost around RM60 per pax that is served with a soup and dessert. By far one of the best Sunday Roast I have had. Definitely a treat for a week of hard work :)"
0,Clarence J.,Jarrod & Rawlins,"Jarrod & Rawlins is a nice, bright, modern restaurant and bar.  The large menu seemed to highlight pork dishes...although those dishes may just have stood out to me since it's not common to see around Malaysia.  The food had good flavor, and the prices were decent.

The restaurant's a smallish place, but it has a decent-sized dining room  A mid-sized bar set about halfway through the restaurant creates a more private-ish segment of the dining area toward the back.  Like most of the restaurants around Plaza Damansara,  Jarrod & Rawlins has a smallish covered dining area at the front, overlooking the street and parking lot.  Friendly staff rounds out the experience."
0,Veronica C.,Jarrod & Rawlins,"This restaurant is one of the oldest English pubs in town. It was first established 11 years ago. One of the owners is a British, Dennis Rawlins and he did a good job in creating a wonderful menu of food to pair with the Glenlivet single malt whisky - 12, 15 & 18 years old.

We were served with 11 course meal and recommended to pair with the different whiskies.
12 years old with the smoked salmon tartar & scotch eggs with English Coleman's mustard.
15 years old with pork confit & beetroot radish, & black pudding.
Lastly, the 18 years old whisky with the plated mini toast beef, roast potato & gravy.

Each glass of whisky enhanced the flavour of our food. Our favourite was the 18 years old Glenlivet that was extremely smooth and has a strong oak taste. The beauty of the pairing experience is it was a wonderful exposure that was new to us and became the centre of our conversation.

Apart from that, the pub was showing live the Melbourne Open and football. Hence, for sports lovers this is great place for you to chill with your friends over a glass of beer/alcohol.

From the menu, the best loved dish is the plated roast beef, roast potato and gravy. When you are there, do not give it a miss.

When Dennis approached me, I complimented his chef and his wait staff, who were courteous. He was very nice to explain that the black pudding (a sausage made from pig's blood and fat) is loved all over Europe. In Germany, it is known as blutwurst. In Portugal, morcela. French as boudin noir. Sanguinaccio in Italian. A culinary walking dictionary!

You definitely do not want to miss out exploring this pub!"
0,Alixandra E.,Rama V,"I decided to check this place out after getting a bit tired of eating street food all the time. I decided I wanted a real, sit down dinner in a relaxed and beautiful atmosphere. Rama V was exactly the place to come. They have incredibly delicious, upscale Thai food and delicious cocktails to go with. The restaurant almost feels like it should be in a hotel with the decor it has. It's really very nice, sleek and modern. It's a surprisingly large restaurant, but it was still decently busy when I went. The tables are set very artistically and you can tell that there was a lot of thought put into the restaurant. The service was very good, although nothing out of the ordinary. I found that most everywhere I went in KL, the service was kind, welcoming and accommodating. Rama V was no exception.

What really set it apart from the crowd was the quality of the food and drinks. One thing I really appreciated about Rama V was the fact that they had a regular menu and at the back was a special vegetarian menu with dozens of delicious options. I shared a couple of dishes with my friend and we I ordered the Vegetarian Spring Rolls, Green Curry with Tofu and Vegetables (Gaeng Kaew Wan Chay) and Stir-fried Mixed Vegetables (Pad Pak Benjarong Chay). Neither of the main courses cost more than 25 RM. Not only was the food affordable, but it was incredibly delicious as well! The spring rolls weren't overly greasy and you could really taste the inside of them, not bland like many spring rolls are. I tasted a lot of spring rolls while I was in KL and these were by far the best I had. The stir-fried vegetables were cooked the perfect amount, not overcooked so they still retained their freshness and bite. They were light and seasoned well. The flavor of the vegetables shone through the dish and certainly wasn't obscured by a heavy sauce or an overwhelming flavor. The green curry was in contrast very strongly flavored, but not at all in a bad way. It was strong, robust and was gloriously rich in coconut milk and lemongrass. It was the best Thai curry I've ever tasted.

The meal was spectacular and the drinks were amazing as well. My friend had a classic Cosmopolitan, while I decided to be adventurous and try their Basil and Lemongrass Mojito. It was served with a giant stalk of lemongrass planted in the middle of the drink. OH MY GOD! Why has no one done this combination before?! The Thai basil with it's slightly anise-y flavor blended perfectly with the lemongrass and the flavor of a classic mojito. I suggest you order at least two!

Overall, it was a stellar and memorable meal! I can't recommend this place higher to people visiting KL."
0,Chriis L.,Rama V,Probably the best Thai restaurant I've ever been. Great environment. Food was great. Price was reasonable too. Highly recommended for special occasions celebrations. You're not gonna regret coming here. Valet parking fees can be waived if you spend over a certain amount.
0,Stephanie X.,Rama V,"I must say that I am a huge fan of Thai food, who isn't? That concoction of sweet, sour & spicy flavors, not forgetting the delightful aroma's.. Okay typing this particular review on an empty tummy right now isn't doing me good!
Rama V opened its doors to the public in 1995 & has been a hit ever since taking home several awards in many food competitions. The authenticity you get from dining here revolves around everything from the taste of the food to the ambiance, layout & the hospitality.
Since it was my first time here, it took me a couple of minutes to actually get to my table. My eyes were busy wondering all over the place observing the statues & paintings as well as their private dining areas which were designed like mini villas surrounding a pond with the statue of Rama himself.
We were first seated in the corner which was a bit secluded so I did request to change our table & with no fuss at all the kind waiter showed us our new table which has a much better view.  I went straight to the mains, giving a pass on the appetizers which I regret so that gives me every reason to head back there again!
Our table was overwhelmed with food, from the Spicy seafood Tom Yum to the vegetarian red curry which included apples & bamboo shoots, the food was simply excellent. By the time we finished we were stuffed so there wasn't much space for a variety of dessert sampling, so we went with the famous mango & sticky rice. The dessert wasn't much to rave about, as I found the sticky rice very dried up & the mangoes were not chilled. That was about the only let down to the place.
Overall I would give them 4 thumbs up & and second visit back there!"
0,Nicole S.,Rama V,"Rama V is a fine thai restaurant located at Ampang Hilir. It used to be very good, serving authentic thai food although at a high price. however in recent years, the quality has dropped remarkably and all you can find on this place are bad reviews. I went with an open mind anyway and was quite disappointed. I mean there's nothing really wrong with the food, its just that you expect more? I mean for the price you're paying and the ambiance of the restaurant, my expectations of the food was also set quite high.

Its a fine dining restaurant so waiters are attentive and very polite. Parking here is easy too as the restaurant is in a bungalow lot so you can park in the compound or along the road outside. I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon as the last visit was thoroughly disappointing."
0,Nadhira S.,Rama V,"I'd say that this is one of the most unique Thai restaurant I've ever experienced in the whole of KL. It is so gracious, yet so elegent - surrounded by lotus blossoms, It is tucked away off of Jalan Tun Razak and away from the busy city. Rama V serves authentic and innovative fine Thai cuisines while trying their best to preserve the old school Thai flavors and tradition...and you can see it by the way they present their dishes. Classic! You will be impressed by the art and love they put into their dishes. I had the clear sauce steamed fish (my favorite) with Tom Yam (served in a coconut shell), Kailan cooked in garlic and oyster sauce, butter fried prawns and chili crab.

Just thinking about it again makes my mouth water. I really recommend this place for anyone that's looking for a quiet place to eat at with amazing food."
0,Azraai A.,Tupai Tupai,"Whenever my parents used to go out for their official dinners, Tupai Tupai became me and my sister's dinner spot when we're too lazy to cook at home. We used to come here a lot because we live not 5 minutes away from there so it's the easiest option whenever we're hungry.

The place is built to look like one of the typical Kampung houses that we have here in Malaysia so the feeling that I get as I walk to the main house is absolutely priceless. I would almost always have Kuey Teow Goreng there and if not ill have the Nasi Campur option, which is also fabulously delicious. My sister would opt for the lamb chop or chicken chops (we have somewhat different tastes in food.) The service is friendly and quick, maybe also a result of us being regulars there.

They would also have steamboat nights on certain nights of the week, and the array of options for you to eat is amazing. Now for these nights, we would almost always have it as a family, it's a good time to let the freak flags fly and see my siblings for what they truly are, barbarians (but the only barbarians that I love.)"
0,Alfie C.,Tupai Tupai,"Tupai-Tupai (squirrel) is one of the best eating spot in the heart of Klang Valley. Don't get me wrong. They don't slaughter and cook squirrels at all. I don't how could they came out with that name but it's the not that point that I want to highlight but the food. The main franchise in KL, just next to Dewan Bahasa & Pustaka (DBP) is the most popular spot but I'm already grateful with the Shah Alam one.

Serving most of the Malay cuisines at their finest. At least 5o types of 'lauk' available daily for the customers during the lunch period. Usually the customers will always go for the Nasi Campur (Mixed Rice) during the lunch because they are free to choose their own foods. But the mixed rice is not the blockbuster that I'm seeking for.

You don't have to come to Tupai-Tupai just to enjoy a plate of plain rice alongside 50 types of 'lauk'. You could get that anyplace else. I'm talking about the greatness pleasure which is the steamboat buffet. The buffet is available every night which you have to pay just RM29 for it. Just get yourself here and enjoy your steamboat. Don't mind the squirrel. Just like I said earlier, it's just a name."
0,Elvi T.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Good, cheap indian food.

Banana leaf style where they give you rice and a few side dishes (the fried bitter gourd is so good and addicting), and then have you choose between fish, chicken, or lamb curry (or a mix).

We ordered a few chicken and a lamb dish - all nothing special just the average chicken Marsala or 65. The best dish though was the squid! It's a little pricier but super worth it.

No air conditioning. Gets hot."
0,Andrea W.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"The ordering process was really confusing, but somehow I ordered the right food. I got a fish curry, and it came with a banana leaf, as well as a bunch of sides that I still don't know what they were to this day. They poured some delicious sauce on top of the rice as well, and it was delicious. My entire big plate was delicious. Originally, they gave me the wrong curry (a chicken curry), but then they realized it and got me fish curry instead. All the flavors were great, and it was a ton of food. Definitely recommend!"
0,Sarah C.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Came here by way of a high recommendation from new Malaysian transplant friends. I was told to just order a banana leaf and they would know. I expected everything that normally comes with south Indian cuisine, just on a banana leaf. That's  pretty much what it was and it was splendidly delicious, filling, and definitely did not disappoint. We each had a banana leaf and a mango lassi, because I wasn't sure what to order for drinks! Safe to say though, I left completely stuffed, banana leaf cleaned, and drink cup empty. I would come back if it weren't so out if the way!! The price was a little more pricy than I expected, but with nothing to compare, it really wasn't that bad. The veg was around 8.50, the chicken was about 12.50 or 13, and the lassis were 6.00!! Total came out about $35. It wasn't terribly expensive, but maybe there are cheaper places?"
0,Amirul R.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"I love banana leaf rice: I'm the kind of guy who can have it twice a day, every day for a week. But if I was going to do that, I'd want it to be Nirvana's. Always full with BLR fans, you'll be surprised by how much rice you can eat there. I'd like to consider myself as having been to enough banana leaf restaurants to know what's good, and Nirvana is the best.

Shame parking in the Telawi area is such a nightmare!"
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Oh yes, my favourite place for banana leaf rice in kl!! Been coming here for years,  and still coming. been a crowded place for years as well, and still is - you might already figure out that this place is really good then.

Free flow of nasi and side dishes when you order your banana leaf rice, so you literally eat all you want. However, do note that sharing is not allowed here. Anyway, that's only logical that you'd have free flow food right?

They have a lot of dishes for you to choose from here, and they will usually start taking your order when you're queuing up. Yes - its only normal that you'd have to queue here, it's that demanded! Please try their squids and fried chicken! Freshly made and sells fast.

For their drinks, if you like yoghurt please please try their mango lassi. My all time favourite here! Really rich and creamy and not too sweet.

Price wise i think its rather fair, however getting a parking spot here is not easy, so cross your fingers yea!"
0,Carmen L.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"This is one of the many Banana leaf rice restaurants in Bangsar. My favourite side dishes in my Banana Leaf rice will and always will be their fried bitter gourd!! The fried bitter gourd here is always my favourite side dish and I always request for more because it's just THAT good. Its chunky and it isn't very bitter like most fried bitter gourds which is the reason why I love it so much.

Located in Jalan Telawi, Bangsar; it's very difficult to find parking spaces especially during peak hours so I suggest that you find a parking spot in Bangsar Village 1 & 2. That would save you so much time from going through all the one way streets and being stuck in the traffic. Expect waiting and queuing up for a seat during peak hours because it can get pretty crowded due to their famous reputation but service is really fast in this restaurant as the staff here can manage really well."
0,Michal F.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Standout Indian restaurant. It's a popular restaurant so you will see lines from afar but they are very efficient and take your order while you are still in line so we only did 20 minutes of waiting. I love this efficiency but perhaps we just hit a light time.

The English here is good and we had no problem ordering. Food wise we really appreciated the authentic presentation on a banana leaf. Prices are very reasonable. We got banana rice with curry rice doused on top and 3 vegetables on the side, both pumpkin and red veggie were delicious."
0,Zilin C.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"This place is always packed to the rafters during lunch hour  - and it is no surprise why it is. They serve one of the best banana leaf rice around the area!

However, the place is not the cleanest and also prices are quite expensive for what it is. However, people still flock to this place because the food is delicious and comes out fast. Service is quite bad - staff can be quite rude and inattentive however it is a place not to chill with friends or hang out, but to eat and go.

Space is also cramped, it is very much a mamak store with both infoor and outdoor seating. I will always come back to Nirwana Maju if im craving for some good banana leaf rice meal and know that I will not get disappointed!"
0,Simina I.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"This is where I tried for the first time Banana Lief in my life. I went with 2 friends of mine to have dinner, and they decided to take me in a new and different restaurant. Well it was definitely a new experience for me. Why??? Because I didn't know that they only serve spicy food and you eat with your hands.

The restaurant is very local, and I heard that is always full. But besides of this, the food is served very fast. The downside of the place is the staff who doesn't speak english, so it's a little hard to talk with them. But I have to say that they are very competent and fast.

The food was good, and the fact that I had to eat with my hands was a nice experience. I would be great if they would serve also non-spicy food for the expats like me.

Overall: If you just arrived in KL, you need to try the food  from here."
0,Pearl-Lyn L.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Every time I crave for banana leaf rice, this is where I'll be! It's no doubt that this place has one of the best banana leaf rice in KL.

There are two things I always look forward when eating this banana leaf rice- the rasam & the deep fried bitter gourd. Rasam is a traditional Indian soup which has a lovely intense flavor. Personally, I love the taste of rasam but many of my friends can't seem to get used to the strong flavor. The deep fried butter gourd on the other hand, is an all time favorite amongst many. Their vegetable sides and curries are also delicious. I would usually drench my rice with the dahl and fish curry until it becomes ""nasi banjir"". Also, the papadum here has the loveliest crunch to it.

The downside of this place would be the crowds as well as the price. I would suggest to never come here during peak hours unless you're ready to brave the crowds and wait for a table. The pricing is also slightly higher compared to many banana leaf rice restaurants but I can assure you that you'll be paying for what it's worth."
0,Kevin W.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Feed me more banana leaf rice!

I was introduced to Sri Nirvana Maju by my fiancée before we were even dating and now I have frequent this place more than her (pss don't tell her that).

I would say this is one of the more pricey Banana leaf rice but there is quality in their food. One of the attraction is their deep fried bittergourd that they serve as one of your vegetable side dish. They are pretty standard serving the same vegetables as their meat and seafood dishes are quite costly.

What I do not like of this place is there are limited space and if you are seated inside when it is crowded, it gets really stuffy and be packed tight.

There is usually a queue, so I suggest to come here during the non-peak meal period to avoid the queue or just be prepared to wait for 5-15 mins to be seated."
0,Shearlee L.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"I understand the hype. Yes it is good, yes there is the queue. Is it mind-blowing? Well, not really..

I've been eating banana leaf rice since I was a little kid, every once in a while I feel the nostalgic need to get my fix. And yes, I always eat with my hands regardless if it's going to discolor my manicure. Perhaps my expectations were very high for this place that is known as ""The best banana leaf in Klang Valley"" but I allowed room for disappointment because I too have heard contrary experiences from friends. Walking in, I was surprised with how tiny the restaurant is, which explained why the sitting is tightly arranged and the environment stuffy.

First of all, I always at least expect three types of good indian vegetables. We were served with half my handful (I have tiny hands) of each long beans and cucumber, a bigger amount of the mixture of fried-curry-powder-battered vegetables (cauliflower/bittergourd/ladies fingers), a small serving of chutney, and some papadam. Personally, I thought that the fried stuff is a side dish and not my main expected share of vegetables. The portion was very little for my liking, and I clearly did not bother asking for refill when I found out that they charge RM1 per refill. But.. isn't that one of the main concepts of banana leaf rice? Free refills of vegetables? Anyway, for one ""set"" of banana leaf rice consisting of the things I mentioned, costs RM9. Expensive? Yes.

The fish curry was not spicy, fishy, sour and thick the way I normally like it, it was watery and.. meh. Dahl was okay. The Chicken Varuval was pretty good, a little spicy and plenty of rempah.

Service is quick and attentive. However, we did not linger around to enjoy our hot drinks or lassi (they have good and thick mango lassi) because there was a queue outside.

Perhaps I am being biased here because banana leaf is sentimental to me but instead I felt like a tourist that was slightly ripped off."
0,Julian T.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Nirvana Maju is no doubt one of the most famous Banana Leaf in town. It is flocked with locals and foreigners all the time. Now, I tend to be picky about Banana Leaf, how's the curry? Are the servings fresh?

Although I think I had better ones than this place, people still crowd it as usual. I mean, the quality isn't all that great and the biggest turn-off was the price they charge here. The idea of having Banana Leaf is to pay one price and have as many rice and sides as you want. Nirvana got the whole idea right untill recently when they decided to charge for extra sides, what?!?

Not just that, even the initial price is already too expensive."
0,Lucie B.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Hands down this is the best banana leaf place around.

The rice is perfect and the dahl is flavorful and not too watery. The best thing though is the fried bittergourd!! So good, I crave it often.

Definitely recommend this place to all looking for a good, low cost meal, its also vegan if you opt out of choosing meat side dishes."
0,Adelynn T.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"One of the best banana leaf rice that I had. The queue is long during weekends and lunch time. Parking is horrible (People tend to double park when they are desperate).

Please park at bangsar village if you want to avoid summons and people honking non stop.

The food is good! Love the deep fried bitter gourd. ;) and also the fried chicken is good. Rasam is good too! Oh, try their lassi. YUMS!"
0,Nicole S.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Nirvana is my second favorite place for banana leaf rice. The reason being the queue  here is just ridiculous. You could go at 4pm on a weekday and there would still be a queue. Also its not nice how you have to leave immediately after you finish your meal because there are many others waiting to sit down.

also i feel the staff here are very rude and unhelpful. I get they are extremely busy but like they can be a little nicer or more helpful. There are a lot of staff but most of them just stand around staring into blank space.

The food here is good, but I think the variety is too limited also the seating is really cramped so you cannot hold a conversation because all you can hear is everyone else's conversation.

Maybe one day when the line isn't too long i might decide to have my banana leaf there."
0,Diviyah G.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Nirvana is one of my favorite places to go to get a quick fix for my banana leaf cravings, Nirvana is located right opposite Bangsar VIllage 2 and its super crowded during lunch time. If you're planning on going there, be there before lunch hour so you do not have to way in the long queue, starving while watching people eat :(  What I love about Nirvana is their fried bitter gourd which is to die for. It is so yummy that you just want to keep eating it. You could also order other side dishes along with your standard banana leaf set such as fried squid,prawns,chicken, fish and a variety of other preparations as well.

Besides banana leaf, Nirvana also serves up other indian dishes as well. What I dislike about Nirvana however, is he fact that the seating is quite close to one another and there isn't much space for yourself or your group of friends/family. In my opinion, the price is slightly more expensive than most banana leaf restaurants. Nirvana offers good tasting banana leaf that I absolutely love but I will always be a Devi's Corner girl at heart. Thats my opinion but you should definitely check Nirvana's out if you're ever craving for some good tasting banana leaf set."
0,Karen D.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Not the best but will do in a pinch. Price is quite high but service has gotten much better. The fish curry is just the way I like it, a little on the sour side."
0,Carmen W.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Am I the only one that thinks Nirvana is aptly named? The only thing you need to know is that the banana leaf are divine. In my humble opinion, they have one of the best combination of condiments which I can find. Purely because of the deep fried crunchy bittergourd. Other than that, the meal also comes with acar-raw marinated cucumber, papadam-crispy cracker, rasam & fried chilli. If none of these are to you liking, it is alright to refuse it. Afterall, personal preferences comes to play here, where you can order freshly fried chicken, fish and many more. Do not be afraid to ask!

The thing that rankles me though is the enormous lunch crowd. But I guess that is to be expected with a place as popular as Nirvana. As such parking may be virtually impossible outside or even inside Bangsar Village. Just a tip, try carpooling as you wont have the hassle of waiting for everyone to get a carpark. Saves so much time."
0,Maggie T.,Sri Nirvana Maju,"Poof!!! This place? BEST BANANA LEAF RICE EVERRRR.

No one can resist it, no one on earth will ever resist this. It's sooooooo gooooddddd I might consider renaming myself after them LOL (sorry Mom and Dad) hahahaha

Well I do know that they are priced slightly higher than usual banana leaf rice but I don't give a shit. I mean not that I'm exaggerating but I think the price with worth paying for because they are able to cook really good.

getting a seat here is kinda hard when it's during peak hours but once you got a seat, everything will be super fast afterwards. They even have a queue of numbers to collect at one point when the crowd is starting to form a long line.

Drinks tasted soso. The main point is the food. I have seen picture frames of their certificate being displayed all over the premise. Shows that they have been featured over and over again by TimeOut Malaysia for being the best Malaysian Flavoured restaurant :)

I will definitely come back again for more of this once in a while. :)"
0,Cyrus A.,Nagasari Curry House,"Great Indian food at a very reasonable price. The naan was out of this world, made fresh on site. The chicken in my meal was seasoned very well, with lots of flavor and the right level of spice. I do wish the sides were different -- I was hoping for more sauces in which to dip that delicious naan, but oh well. Maybe a better option is to order individual sides rather than going for the platter?

This isn't the cleanest restaurant you can eat at, and it certainly isn't the quickest, but if you have some time and want a great deal on quality Indian food (especially in this touristy neighborhood), then this is a great option."
0,Min C.,Nagasari Curry House,"Came here for dinner while I was visiting KL and this place was worth the find! We came here Saturday night for dinner and it wasn't packed at all and another great thing is the location of this place is right in the middle of the ""main bar/club street"" area where all the tourists/backpackers go for a night out.

Interior of the place is decent size and they have the food out so you can see what to order. They had a big fire roasting pot that was cooking the meat on sticks inside the pot (really bad at describing this lol but see pics attached!). We ordered the house plate which included the masala chicken and tandoori chicke which came with rice and veggies including chickpeas and spinach dip. Of course, we couldn't forget the naan bread :P Food is very flavorful and filling so if you plan on drinking heavily afterwards, I would suggest not to eat much cause it can definitely cause some stomach issues (and then bathroom issues if you know what I'm saying) I also ordered a watermelon drink but wouldn't recommend any of their drinks cause they tend to put a lot of sugar in their drinks so it was way too sweet. I would just stick with water *BOTTLED WATER*

Overall, good food in a great location and inexpensive. Each meal is around $6-7 depending on what you get and how much."
0,Wina K.,Nagasari Curry House,"Love this place!! Wonderful variety, delicious food & quick service!

First time, we ordered the tandoori chicken plate. It included naan, juicy white meat chicken (I don't eat white meat but I ate this one!!)  

Second time, we ordered the tandoori again but also added a butter chicken & masala dosa.

Everything was tasty & satisfying but the ambiance could be better. There were fans but no a/c and you can smoke cigarettes anywhere in the restaurant.

Overall, delicious food & service was fantastic from a super cute female Malay server that was always smiling. The man who appeared as the owner was always very kind & attentive. Will likely be back for a third time on this holiday! Yum!"
0,William D.,Nagasari Curry House,"This place is a diamond in the rough. For many years it had a much better location right on the busy part of Jalan Nagasari and had awesome outdoor seating but it recently moved around the corner and is now mostly inside.  The food however is still awesome and so cheap.  

The food here is mostly North Indian or even Bangali if I am not mistaken. In any case it is great food and cheap beer. A perfect spot for when you are hungry after a night out on Changkat.  Of course, they are also open 24hrs.

I LOVE this naan bread they have here called Kima naan.  I know it sounds weird but that is right.  It is the only place I have ever seen it offered.  It is basically tandoori chicken shredded and stuffed inside a piece of naan bread.  I can't figure out why I haven't seen this in more places.  It seems like such an obvious and awesome idea."
0,Ian L.,Nagasari Curry House,"As the name suggests, curry is the main star here. And a delicious one too. The humble little mamak alike restaurant serves different kinds of curries. We especially like the chicken and veggie ones.
   The banana leaf is also a crowd's favorite. Our guilty pleasure is the fragrant nasi lemak. Nagasari is also one of the few mamak-s which serves alcohol.
   Due to its strategic location, Nagasari is almost brimming with customers, from locals to tourists. Popular for after-club supper."
0,Vanessa O.,Kedai Kopi Mee Bon,"This place is famous for its dim sum in Jalan Ipoh and it is a must go for the locals. It is open 24 hours and this place has more than 40 years history for their delicious dim sum. My dad's school mate is actually running this shop and it is taken up from his father. Pau here is very famous and their lor mai kai is extremely delicious.

Since they are doing dimsum, don't be surprise for not finding fried items because they only specialised on steaming dimsums. My favourite type of cuisine!!! Fried food is quite bad for health and we should eat less of it!

If you want to dine here, it is open air and you will expect yourself to be seated on the wide pathway. There are umbrellas - those commercial umbrellas that will protect you from the sun or rain.

Parking is relatively hard to get, so tough luck people! You should only drive here, although there is a bus stop 5 minutes walking distance, you will feel tired if walking under the hot weather.

Price? Quite expensive for me, so be prepared to pay! Cash and carry only."
0,Onn Rei T.,Kedai Kopi Mee Bon,"This place brings back memories of when i was a kid and my dad brings us for Dim Sum either very early in the morning or very late at night.

One of the key things of this dim sum place is that it may not be the best in terms of quality but it is delicious that carries a hint of local taste. It serves steamed dim sum so don't expect to find any fried ones here. the Char Siu Pao is a definite favourite of mine. If the staff isn't lazy, you will see Lor Mai Kai being flipped mid air while the bring it to you! (yes that's their signature.)

It is great for breakfast (though you will find it difficult to look for parking), lunch or even supper (especially after a few drinks). Do take the effort to visit this old yet awesome dim sum place which can offer a satisfactory meal.

Price wise, well, it is dim sum, so expect it to be around 15-20 per pax (if you order 3 plates). it is an average of RM5 per plate. the Pao has different rates."
0,Alexander Kim Wooi L.,Kedai Kopi Mee Bon,"Despite the plentiful bad reviews that this place has started to get online, I still decide to give it a 4-stars rating.

I think people were very misled when they first visit the place expecting some extravagant dimsum to be served. However, this restaurant is actually a very old fashioned and humble kind of place that serves dimsum.

So, yes, even though a lot of people complained that their dimsums here are all just dumpling with minced pork in it, I would say that this is actually their style. Besides that, they area actually being famous for their paos and also dumplings here. So, whenever you're there, the first question they will come to ask you is if you want any paos or lo mai gai that's actually the signature dishes here.

I have tried and liked the place actually, despite of the difficulties in getting a parking here.

However, there's one thing that makes me hesitate in giving more stars which is their price. Even though it looks like a humble little shop, my friend and I who ordered less than ten dishes with two herbal teas actually paid around RM36, so the prices here are not as cheap as you'd think it would be.

Overall, it's a place which will remind you of the old times good dimsums in my opinion.

If you're a dimsum fanatic, do explore the place for yourself."
0,Alexis G.,Kedai Kopi Mee Bon,"This is one of my favourite dim sum place to go for, the food quality is great! As everything is becoming very commercialized nowadays, I really appreciate the natural and classic way they prepare their food. The fillings of the dim sum taste very natural, like it's freshly blended for the day and not purchased frozen. The same goes to other meat based dum sum dishes as well. One downside is that sometimes the fried dim sums can be tad a bit oily, apart from that, it tastes absolutely amazing.

The shop is open in the morning for the breakfast crown until late afternoon and even during dinner until midnight! I always come over here for supper after drinking at the bars in Publika and they are always still open. Perfect supper place after drinking as there will be less crowd and the food is still steaming hot. During peak hours (breakfast and dinner) there might be quite a crowd and parking is hard to find, so you will need to park slightly further."
0,Umar R.,THIRTY8,"Be ready to soar high and be sugar high at Thirty8 at the Grand Hyatt KL

At RM 103 for their ""high on sugar"" afternoon tea (Friday, Saturday and selected Public Holidays) or RM 80 for the ""elegant afternoon tea"" (Monday to Thursdays),  it comes to no surprise, that the afternoon tea at the Grand Hyatt KL would trigger a question of sensibility. I mean is it worth it ? The answer to that is yes to those who enjoy artisanal desserts, 7 choices of teas, plus a wide variety  of coffee, and for those whom appreciates breathtaking views, indulge in the  panoramic view of the city of Kuala Lumpur 38 floors high.

The high on sugar afternoon tea is an open buffet that starts at 3pm and ends at 5.30 pm ( which means you can have as much as you want), and they weren't kidding when they used the word ""high"" on sugar, because it's definitely a sugar overload : which includes cakes, scones, hand made chocolates, nitrogen ice cream, sandwiches, macaroons, cookies and so much more. The buffet also includes 7 varieties of artisanal loose leaf tea blends, 7 varieties of coffee styles, and a selection of hot asian tidbits ( on your request)

The variety of cakes and dessert includes: cheesecakes, chocolate torte, blueberry tart, Victoria sandwich, hazelnut eclairs, gastronomic cupcakes and so much more. Additionally there are 2 varieties of scones: plain and raisin, served with clotted cream and two varieties of fresh preserve. The sugar high journey continues with 3 varieties of ice cream, prepared on the spot by their chef using liquid nitrogen.

I do appreciate the 7 choices of tea, with my favorite being the rose petal tea, its very aromatic, relaxing and fragrant. Also with the high on sugar is the wide choices of lattes, cappuccino and etc. However the coffee is made by a machine, so don't expect a latte art. Also their dim sum seem frozen and not made fresh, quite disappointing for a 5 star hotel.

The elegant afternoon tea on weekdays is a little different, it's not a buffet, instead it's the customary three tier platter of dessert, sandwiched and scones. The choices maybe more limited for this option.

Their service is impeccable, fast and very friendly. Not once was my water glass left empty. Almost everything for the buffet is self service, however anyone could still request to be served if needed.

Seating is first come first serve, therefore for those who want to be seated as close to the window and enjoy the closer view by the bay windows, come early, or try to call ahead. But don't fret if you cant come early every seat for the tea, has a gorgeous view of the KL skyline. Choice of seats includes tables and chairs or booth seats.

The afternoon tea at Thirty8 may disappoint those who expect a traditional royal english tea, complete with the quaint cups, the butler like service and the elegant decor of an english castle or colonial ranch; think Downton Abby. Because the decor and tableware here is very modern, and the food selection offers some traditional english food, with added french favorites and even asian tidbits.

The grand hyatt has its own parking garage in the basement 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM: First hour MYR 15.00, Subsequent hours: MYR 5.00, 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM: MYR 15.00 flat rate. They also have valet, MYR 25.00 plus parking fee.

There are some room for improvements: firstly the dimsum tasted like it was cooked from frozen, I would have appreciated a freshly made gourmet dim sum., if that is not possible, maybe fresh spring rolls or egg rolls or fritters could be a replacement. Secondly, the coffee served was not gourmet, I wish they had an in house barista who made gourmet cup of latte and etc. Finally the cups used is too big for the tea, I wish they used an 8oz cups for an english tea setting."
0,Mathieu L.,THIRTY8,"Great location on the 38th floor of the Hyatt in central KL. Very attentive service, delicious food and great views for dinner"
0,Stephanie V.,THIRTY8,"Great views of the towers and decent drinks but I would skip the food. Very sub par and nothing memorable. Service is slow and spotty and leaves much to be had given the price point.

Views of the towers, yea they are nice but food and service are both lacking at this restaurant and I'm disappointed in my overall experience. We ordered the set menu for 2 and appetizer had no cohesion nor were any of them prepared appropriately. Not to mentioned we had to ask for our beverages again upon serving of the first course"
0,Nicole S.,THIRTY8,"Let me just say first off that the service here is fantastic. The waiters were fast and courteous and kept all our water glasses topped up. (Plus my friends and I made one of them take a million pictures for us). My friend made a reservation for us and our table had the Petronas Twin Towers in the background and it was gorgeous.

We ordered 4 sets of Afternoon Tea (RM68+ per person) and when it came it proved to be quite a lot and well worth the money.Scones with Jam and Chantilly Cream, Strawberry,Orange and Vanilla Macaroons, 2 different cakes,a spongy caramel filled tart,Almond Biscotti,Hazelnut Eclairs and a milky/foamy pudding.

The set also came with some savory options as well which came in the form of 3 different types of finger sandwiches, Tuna, Egg Mayo, and Ham,Cheese and Cucumber, which was a good balance to all the decadent sweet treats. The rest of my friends ordered tea as their drinks but I decided to get a Hot Chocolate and I can confidently say it's some of the best hot chocolate I've had in KL. Thick and creamy and ever so rich is the only way I can describe it."
0,Eunice C.,THIRTY8,"This is definitely not your average day-to-day eatery where you will be able to dine and unwind with short pants and t-shirts. In here, you'll need to abide to some proper dress code or not you'll end up looking underdressed. As usual for guys, you will need to put on some proper pants and shirts while the ladies can come in with a lovely dress; simple.

I listen to all the chattering that this place serves the best dessert. All I can say is that, it is so not true. In all honestly, it doesn't serve the best taste dessert, but it serves the most expensive best looking desserts. See the difference? If you wish to have instagram-able desserts, then this is an ideal place to visit.

I can't give my comments on the main course as I've only tried having desserts here. Truth to be told, I don't mind coming here to have a good dinner with my love one. Spending time here can be one of the best experiences one will ever have as the ambience is so serene and calm. What do you expect when you are paying more than double of the price of a dessert you can get in any other dessert joints? On top of that, you will be able to enjoy a good conversation with your friends or love ones as the crowd here practices peace and quiet.

If you wish to patronize this place, please get ready with some extra cash or a credit card as this place is going to charge you with an amount that is beyond your expectation. Nonetheless, if you have the extra budget, this place is a must-go as it is the perfect place to spend some good quality time here where you will be able to enjoy live band music while facing the magnificent scenic view of Kuala Lumpur."
0,Harvey T.,THIRTY8,"It's a very great place to enjoy the KL view and listen to some jazz music with dime lighting. In another word, it's romantic!

I was here last year with my good friends to celebrate my birthday. They will prepare a special dessert with some smoke from dry ice inside for a birthday girl and the crews will be standing together singing birthday song for you. It's a unforgettable and beautiful moment!

I believe most of the people were here to experienced the ambient and romance. To be honest, the foods are just okay and I don't really fond the captain who serving us that night, I feel he is a bit pushy and keep recommending us to order expensive foods, and when we don't, he was showing us that kind of face. I hope they will improve their service upon my next visit."
0,Pearl-Lyn L.,THIRTY8,"Had tea here with three of my other girlfriends the other day after hearing many raves about this place! I actually made a booking in advance and was given a table facing the Petronas Twin Towers which was amazing.

We ordered the afternoon tea set which was RM68++ per person and I must say the spread is really worth the price. Each set comes with a wide variety of sweet and savory treats as well as a choice of tea or coffee. The sweet treats includes scones with jam and cream, hazelnut eclairs, macarons, biscotti and more sweets which I could not remember the names to. Savory treats were egg mayo sandwiches, tuna sandwiches & ham and cheese sandwiches. Loved the generous spread but taste wise, not much to shout about. Hopefully they'll change up their cakes as I found it slightly too dry for my liking.

Also, I chose the pu-er tea as my choice of beverage and I'm glad I did! I really enjoyed the wonderful earthy taste and aroma of the tea. Would really recommend that if you're into Chinese teas like me.

Above all that, I must point out that the service at Thirty8 is excellent. The waiters and waitresses were extremely polite and helpful. A few of the waiters actually helped my friends and I take quite a number of photos as we were really fussy. One of them even went to the trouble of squatting down just so the Petronas Twin Towers could be seen in our photographs!

It was such a pleasant experience dining there and I'd definitely be back the next time to try the Thirty8 signature cake :)"
0,Shuen P.,THIRTY8,"Every dessert lover have been talking about this place like they're the dessert heaven. Knowing that I love desserts, my loving hubby brought us there one weekend afternoon. We have a cuppa coffee each and their famous thirty8 signature cake.

Doesn't really like the signature cake though because I would prefer it more if the caramel sauce is replaced with milk chocolate. Besides, I'm not a fan of banana flavored ice cream. The signature cake comes with a scoop of ice cream which is banana ice cream! The last thing on earth that I'll want to have. Banana is not my thing. Saddening.

Well, at least I've experienced thirty8 signature cake, just not my favorite. Anyway, thirty8 looked like a nice place to have hi-tea at. Might be going back for that instead.

However, the view of KL city from the restaurant was awesome."
0,Sarah P.,THIRTY8,"Recently dined here with my wife. Pretty good view
Pretty good value. The price was a little high for what you get.
We did the high tea. Plenty of sweet dishes to pick through.
Some sandwiches to try too, but not a good selection at all.
The sweets were plentiful and delicious, but there's only so much that you can eat.
The view of the twin towers during the day was good, not great.
I really think it would be best to visit this restaurant at night to take in the view of the magnificent towers near by."
0,Trena M.,THIRTY8,"I was a little disappointed with this place. With a location right across from the petronas towers, you know most people that done here are there for the view. Still, thirty8 could've put a lot more effort into the food. They serve a decent mix of Western and Asian food, with meat, seafood and vegetarian choices, making it a good option for almost everyone.

We ordered a couple rolls of sushi as an appetizer, one California roll and a veggie roll. Both were pretty bland, and consisted of more rice than filling. For our main course we got the lamb and the chicken. The lamb was cooked well and came with 'chimichuri sauce.' I say 'chimichuri sauce' because it mostly parsley and some tomato in a pool of olive oil--it was not good. The chicken was a little dry, and to make things worse only came with a half a lemon--no spice, and no flavor.

I would say this is a nice place to get a drink or desert while you enjoy the view, but there are plenty of other hotels and bars that offer the same--Sky bar, Marini's or Heli Lounge. There isn't much that sets thirty8 apart."
0,Khalisah K.,THIRTY8,"I just like coming here for the view, all i can say that it is just stunning. Kuala Lumpur is indeed beautiful i wish there was more places with an amazing as this.

It is however a little pricey to dine here but you definitely get what you pay for. The food here is fantastic but the desserts arent that great! Pretty but nothing more.

My visits here would usually be for a cup of coffee and drinks with friends after a hards day work, where we would unwind and relax with a good view and juicy conversations."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,THIRTY8,"Thirty8 just screams luxury and sophistication, from the grand spiral stairs the moment you walk in the lobby till the grand piano with an amazing live band.
We were seated really quickly as we made reservations, you can always ask for a table with the Twin Towers as your backdrop if there is an empty table, which we did and was lucky.
Skipped right through to the dessert page but the menu (available online), was clean and understandable, with clear explanations so fret not about ordering the wrong dish.
We had the Straight from the oven chocolate cake, raspberry sherbet, vanilla anglaise sauce (RM28) and their Signature cake (RM38). Both of the cakes were amazing, the right sweetness paired with a tad bit of sourness from the sorbets made it the perfect dessert to end a birthday night. Not forgetting the gorgeous iconic Twin Towers at the back, watching us as we indulged.
Thirty8 is wonderful! Good food, efficient service and I would say that it's worth the first degree burn in your wallet, but hey you get great music, remarkable ambience, and two waiters to sing you a Birthday song."
0,Jyn-Mun N.,THIRTY8,"You can experience a breathtaking view of KL from Thirty8 while having delicious bread and mashed potatoes. There are different cuisines for Thirty8, which consist of Western, Japanese and so on. The restaurant features Australian Wagyu and Angus steak, sashimi and straight from the oven chocolate cakes. The price is quite expensive, but the service is good and the food comes at a good pace."
0,William D.,Tehran Restoran,"This was the first Persian food I have ever tried. Coming from the US I can't say I ran into a lot of Iranian things anywhere. That being said, places like this are the reason why I love living in Malaysia. This restaurants might be home to the best rice I have ever tasted.

If you have never had Persian barbecue you must try it. It is one of the most beautifully simple cuisines that I have come across. There is almost no oil and they use fresh herbs to complement the simple cooked meat. The fresh basil is always so aromatic and flavorful.

The rice at this place is mind blowing.  I'm not going to lie and say they don't use any butter because I think there is quite a bit of butter in there. However, you can tell that it's real butter so I don't mind as much.  It still tastes so fluffy, pure and delicious."
0,James L.,Nasi Lemak 222,"I've only been here late nights after clubbing or sports. And that means it's in the early hours of the morning.

The place seems to come alive only after 3am and you can see flock of crowds keep coming in. Those with thick make up, you know they are from clubs. Those with singlets, you know they just finish their ball games.

And here's my theory on why their nasi lemak is so good. Your taste buds would be so numb from the drinking or you'll be so hungry after the game that you'll claim that this is one of the best nasi lemak.

Do try them and let me know your thoughts!"
0,Vivian Y.,Nasi Lemak 222,"Nasi lemak is pretty famous around the area. This place is one of the ones that open till late and I mean very late like past 3am and this place is still open. It's really cheap and they are super small packets of nasi lemak but it's pretty good for a late night craving of it. You'll definitely walk home satisfied. The wait isn't too long and it isn't too hard to find. This middle aged malay lady is selling it and their booth is usually there maybe after dinner time. it's a little difficult to catch, their business times that is, but it's around most days and most times of the day.

Give it a try if you're having them nasi lemak midnight cravings!"
0,Evelyn W.,Nasi Lemak 222,"Solid nasi lemak using the sambal as a taste test, but we may have been overcharged (RM2.70 vs. RM 1.50 on the signboard, but may have misunderstood somehow). Pretty deserted in the late morning vs. The roaring late night crowds. Either way, that doesn't affect my rating but will check next time I'm here!"
0,Clarence J.,Babe,"This was a wonderful, fun, and tasty experience!  Keiko S.'s review was pretty much spot on; I can't speak to the authenticity of the Japanese flavors, but I thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of flavors and the creativity and thought that went into crafting each dish's flavor profile and look.  Like Keiko, I'll try to avoid spoilers here.  I will say that among the surprises for me was a dish I _usually_ dislike but thoroughly enjoyed here (as did everyone who normally liked the dish) and a dish I _always_ dislike but I also thoroughly enjoyed here (again, as did everyone I was with who normally liked that dish).  My favorites...well, I can't really lay them out without spoilers.  I will say that my favorite type of sushi was taken to another level here with a somewhat simple but brilliantly creative addition.  And...  Nah -- I'll let you discover the rest for yourself.  (It's too hard to not gush about the details!)  I would be very happy to have the identical menu again -- although if doubling up on one or two dishes was an option, then there're one or two I'd be willing to drop in favor of more of others -- but I look forward to seeing what new things come out of the kitchen as well.

The drinks menu was large and varied, with a good-sized selection of creative cocktails.  I had the ""Edible Mai Tai"" and the ""Ice Breaker Martini.""  The first was perfect pineapple infused or injected with the other ingredients, which was a wonderful way to serve a mai tai.  The second was a vodka-and-elderflower martini with liquid nitrogen poured in; I'm not normally a martini fan, but this one was excellent.  (However, while the liquid nitrogen made a fun roiling fog display from the rapidly chilling drink in its beautiful copper martini glass -- and again, the taste was excellent -- I was disappointed that the promised ice covering never materialized.  That may have been because of the high humidity on the night I was there though.)  I would definitely order both again...although there are also so many other interesting choices!

The view...outstanding -- a stand back view of KL, stretching from north of downtown through south of Brickfields.  From the large outdoor dining space, an fully open wall reveals the view (over a narrow, shallow pool extension with reclining seating in it).  Wooden shades can be pulled down if need be, although we were here on a rainy night and the extended roofline kept the restaurant dry.  An open side of the restaurant stretches beside a swimming pool and has glass wall panels that can be pulled into place as needed.  There's a large spiral staircase in one 'corner' of the outdoor space, which looks like it goes up one floor and down two; I'm not sure if this is part of the restaurant or a vestige of an earlier use for the space.

The staff -- host, waiters/waitresses, cooks, and chef -- were all warm, welcoming, efficient, and patient, with ready smiles.  And again, all those in the kitchen really know their stuff.  Also, different staff members presented each dish, which was a nice touch; some seemed more comfortable explaining and discussing the food -- especially in English -- than others, but we really appreciated the personal touch.

Babe is very pricey, but I thought the food, the drinks, the experience, the people, and the view, were all worth the splurge.  I look forward to the next time I can enjoy them all!"
0,Eddie A.,Babe,Amazing experience. The creativity in food preparation as well as the combination of flavors and service was amazing. We will definitely return every time we visit Malaysia.
0,Kels E.,Babe,"I was a little confused by this meal. It was creative and visually pleasing, don't get me wrong, but out of the 12 or so dishes less than half I would say were ""good"".. and none I would call ""memorable"". The quality did not match the price; the fish did not taste very fresh and it kinda turned me off. The service was also strange, servers were either nervous and quick to explain the dish or sort of rude. The view, however, was amazing. Very small bites but by the end of 12 courses you feel just full enough. I can appreciate molecular dinning but BABE missed it for me, some ingredient combinations just did not work. Not authentically Japanese at all, but I don't think that's what they're going for anyways."
0,Sara M.,Sari Ratu Prima,"This is one of the local restaurants you'll find around! I really liked it and I think it's a great place to try local food! you'd be surprised at how amazingly tasty it is! The staff are very kind and they'll help you make a pick, they don't really speak english though.

This is located on the ground floor food court so you have this whole seating area where you can eat. I think it can get really loud when the place is full,so it can get loud and you wouldn't get to focus if you are trying to have a conversation."
0,Veronica C.,One Six Five,"There is nothing I can find fault with this restaurant and bar. After all, it is a restaurant in a luxury hotel. I enjoyed their smoked salmon salad."
0,Jason Y.,One Six Five,"Located near Intermark and KLCC. The cafe is located underneath the grand stairs which is not a very decent place to dine as a giant structure is hovering right above our heads. There is however a nice view behind with a mini waterfall and garden to walk around, good for taking pictures. Their menu is really unique as they have a choice of Western high tea set or a Malay high tea for the same price. Western set came with the typical scones and pastries while the Malay set had a variety of Malay kuih which is rather unique as not many places has it. The food is rather good and they had lots of selection of tea. The tea choices are also rather unique and I had earl grey mixed with some flower that made the tea very aromatic and fragrant."
0,Eveline L.,Dim Sum & Co,"Unusual pairing of dim sum and beer is what you'll find here in Dim Sum & Co. Best of all, you can come with your Muslim friends since it is pork and lard free! Freshly made dim sum is served from 8am and throughout the whole day while the bar (The Beer Factory Express) is open from 4pm till midnight. You can easily find this place by walking out from MPH and then take a left turn, crossing the road. At night, they will have their signboard brightly lighted up so you won't have a hard time finding them.

For a pork and lard free dim sum, their offerings here are really delicious, almost as good as the authentic Chinese dim sum you get at non halal places. I would highly recommend to get their milk tea which has the perfect amount of sweetnes without being too sweet. As for dim sum, I enjoyed the Szechuan Dumplings, fish balls, and Crispy Avo Rolls the most. Prices are really reasonable since they are between RM6.90 to RM9.90! For desserts, go for the lemon grass jelly for a refreshing finish to your meal. If you bring your kids here, do order the cute molten charcoal bun (lao sa bao).

This is no doubt a place for you to get your dim sum fix at affordable price that do not compromise with taste and ambiance."
0,John W.,Wan Tan Mee Sg Besi,"- Night time restaurant
- Very famous for its Wan Tan Mee as obvious by it's name
- choices of meat - char siew, ginger duck, pig leg, stew pork, and WILD BOAR CURRY.
- Very famous for its wild boar curry
- There's a parking lot behind the shop. You can turn into it before reaching the store.
- Highly recommend"
0,Alfie C.,Wei Ji Claypot Chicken Rice,"Are you still searching for a place that serves one of the greatest Claypot Chicken Rice in town ? Well, this place is definitely for you.

The claypot chicken rice here are cooked by using the traditional method. Yeah, they were cook on a charcoal. It's hard to find any delicious foods that still using some ancient method nowadays. The portion is quite enormous. The rice were plenty and the chicken was huge. You might wanna share it even though they are saying that it's only for 1 pax only.

Plus, the price here is considered cheap and reasonable considering the taste and the size of the portions."
0,Umar R.,Sushi Mentai,"As far a conveyer-belt sushi goes, 'Sushi Mentai' is a hands down the best value for money: portion and price. When it comes to quality, I have to be honest, the fish is fresh but its sushi is still of inferior quality and taste, and I think thats typical with any conveyer-belt style sushi.

However, with that said, I think that Sushi Mentai is by far the best out of all the competition I have been to in Kuala Lumpur (Compared to sushi tei, sushi king, sushi zanmai) and the cheapest too, with only 2 price options: orange plates at RM 2 and red plates at RM3.

They don't stop at just sushi, the restaurant also offers ""a-la-carte items, such as sashimi, udon, salads, special maki hand rolls, grilled fish, tempura, Japanese curry. The prices here is not as cheap as their sushi plates, but its affordable and highly value for money, price ranges anywhere from RM 4 to RM 20.

I did try one of the salmon sashimi at RM10.80, with 5 thick cuts of salmon served over a bed of ice. The taste of the salmon is fresh and the presentation very nice, nevertheless there is a slight fishy taste, don't misunderstand me, the fish is fresh, but it's not flawless like a salmon sashimi at rakuzen.

Now lets talk about the plate sushi. Overall the taste of the sushi is great, but it's definitely not the best sushi anyone would ever taste. I do have to admit, their rice texture and taste was pretty on point though. The rice was moist, yet not too sticky, and has that light tangy taste from the rice wine. I do admire how the restaurant manages to keep each sushi rice slightly warm.

The toppings were varied, they offer : salmon , white tuna, shrimp, unagi, scallop, clam, octopus and a variety of maki's - rolls. All at the humble price of RM 3 per plate. The cheaper plate, RM 2 offers toppings such as: egg, crabstick, shrimp roe, chicken floss, tuna mayo, jellyfish, edamame and etc.

The ambience of this branch in Kepong is pretty simple and sits about 40 -50 people in one sitting. They have bar tables for individuals of couples, and table that accommodates up to 6 people. Expect this place to fill up during lunch and dinner, or weekends. So do come early.

Parking is available on the street, parking is a challenge I must admit. But for cheap value for money sushi- its worth it."
0,Anita C.,Sushi Mentai,"Hmm I don't know. I was more excited about this place before going in and wasn't anymore after I sat down. The sushi rotating around the belt didn't look too appetizing. We didn't end up getting that many from what's already on the belt. But did you know that you can order it if you see it on the menu that's not on the belt. Like the eel and tuna we ordered. Yellow plate is 1.80, orange plate is 2.80. We also got tempura which is eh, not even close to the fluffy light ones in japan of course.

Overall bill was 30+ MYR but it feels like we didn't even eat much. I'd rather get something from the many other food choices near this place."
0,Julian T.,Sushi Mentai,"Best, sushi, place, ever! For me at least. I've been only eating sushi at known places like Sushi Tei and Sushi Zanmai, etc. But this little place in Kepong changed all that for me now. The reason for this is really simple, affordable and worth it!

They only have 2 prices for everything here, either RM1.80 or RM2.80. Yes, now here's the most asked question I'll always receive first, how bout the salmon? Yes, the salmon sushi here only costs RM2.80! For scale, a normal Salmon Mentai costs about RM6 - RM7 in other known sushi places. I've been having Unagi (Eel) for about RM9 my whole life, till I had one for RM2.80 here.

Yes, yes I'm mentioning lots of prices, but thats the beauty of the of this place!

A single sushi belt operates in the middle of the place, with single seats and table seatings. They also have a menu for set meals or any specific sushi rolls you want to order. The area here is quite congested, so you might have to park a tad bit far and walk to the place, but that's no biggie I'm sure."
0,Lachmanasegran N.,Wong Si Nai Cafe,"A true hidden gem amidst hustle and bustle of the city, lies Wong Si Nai.  A family operated café  like concept is not easily found. But thankfully you have their extremely regular customer to make things easy.

Getting there is pretty simple by the LRT. Alight the train at Pudu Station (Ampang Line), and head towards the rear exit. Walk down the flight of stairs, you'll notice a convenience store at the bottom, and then turn to your left. Wong Si Nai will be directly across the alley.

Walking into the building will reveal a very homely environment, the waiters are the owner's sons, the cashier is their mum, and dad being the chef.

There is a huge glass wall on both side of the wall where you can write notes or anything either on pieces of paper or on the glass itself. It's a great concept to treasure memories, I would think. Be warned not to lean on the glass tho.
They are famous for the unique names given to their drinks, the Bubble Tea specifically. Names like Homosexual, I Love You, I Miss You, and Poison will definitely intrigued you for a try.

My all-time favorite is the Wet Butter Chicken. Fried chicken pieces cooked and coated in a thick buttery sauce served with rice ought to make your knees week (careful not to lean on the glass for support!). There is something to it that gives you the warm cozy home cooked sentiment.  
Prices are based on normal café prices."
0,Julian T.,Wong Si Nai Cafe,"A little cafe hidden away from the streets of town, I only got to know this place from a friend and I've never stopped coming since then. Its a small cosy cafe run by a family.

What makes this place so special is their Chicken. It comes in almost a dozen varieties, so you will definitely find one that suits your taste. I usually have the combo, which is two varieties of chicken with rice. My recommendation is to have the Wet Butter Chicken and Marmite Chicken. Once you taste it, you will never forget this place.

They also have what I call the Childhood Bubble Tea, the one made from powder and was very popular before the big ones like Chatime and Gongcha hit the market. Like I said, its pretty well hidden, so one way to find this place is to look for the Pudu Station, its right in front of the rear station entrance."
0,Terry M.,Sukiya,"In Sunway Velocity Mall there are a lot of eating options to choose from, especially Japanese food. My wife and I decided to try this one as it had a more diverse menu and decent prices.

I had the Chicken Katsu and Beef with the optional add on of Miso soup and Chicken Karagi (deep fried marinated chicken pieces).

The Chicken Katsu was a nice moist and tender fillet crumbed and deep fried placed over a bowl of Japanese rice that had been seasoned. The beef was thinly sliced and cooked in a ""special"" sauce and was also very flavoursome.  All this was covered in beaten egg and lightly grilled to set the egg.

The Chicken Karagi and Miso soup were both delicious.

My wife had the Okiyu Chicken and Gyoza Zen menu which included chicken with egg on rice, the savoury Seafood egg custard, miso soup, 3 side dishes (soy beans in sesame Dressing, squid, creamed potato salad), watermelon.

We also ordered the octopus balls as a side and they were crunchy on the outside and creamy and delicious on the inside.

This was all washed down with iced Macha green tea.

All round great meal and at $57 Ringgit not a bad price."
0,Penny W.,Chong Ko Hakka Noodle,"If you like homemade chewy noodles with bland taste, this will be the best place to go. People who eat here either love it or dislike it because it might be quite tasteless. When I was young, I have it for lunch almost every week. I personally love it because the minced pork it does not overpower the taste of the noodles and I usually have it with pork balls and fish balls. The pork balls and fish balls are just mediocre. I have also tried their chicken feet dish and curry noodles before. The chicken feet dish is quite delicious but the curry noodles isn't very impressive.

This place is usually packed with hungry eaters on Sunday and parking might be an issue because there are a few more restaurants around the same area. On weekdays, a parking spot costs around RM2/3."
0,Su Zanne C.,Chong Ko Hakka Noodle,"My family's a regular customer of this place. They serve the best Hakka noodles in town. The noodles appear really simple with just some minced pork, fish balls, and a special soup soup to pour over. Mixed them up a voila! Your Hakka noodle is ready to eat. You can add some pork balls as a side. I love their pork balls. It's smooth but it doesn't taste like flour, I assure you that. The soup for the pork balls are different than the ones given for the noodles. It's a bit more bland. You can choose to drink the soup if you'd like, but try not to mix it with the noodles. It may not look much but it is very filling. Looks can be deceiving as the saying goes. You can order a large packet or bowl of noodles if you're a big eater."
0,Rachel R.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"Are you a vegetarian? Do you have any vegetarian friends? If so, get over here now!

As a long-time vegetarian, I spent 3 weeks in Malaysia trying to avoid unexpected prawns or surprise meat.  It was so amazing to find an entire hawker centre with exclusively vegetarian dishes! Such a relief to be able to order anything and not have to worry about it!  Plus, their food is amazing!

The Curry Mee was my absolute favourite - in fact, I went twice in 24 hours as I was leaving the country and knew I would regret it if I didn't.  The broth was so flavourful and the noodles were accompanied by tons of veggies and fake meats.  Even my meat-eating friends admitted it was great.

The people there are so nice and welcoming.  And they have napkins - a rarity for a food court.

Sadly, they didn't have (fake) chicken rice when I was there, but the other dishes didn't disappoint.  

They close at 6pm though, so go during the day and bring cash."
0,Vinay P.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,This unassuming restaurant houses one of the best meals (meat or otherwise) we had on our 2 week trip to Southeast Asia. The Char Kway Teow was insanely good. The Assam Laksa was not my favorite (probably just dish preference) but my wife thought it was the best thing she had all trip. And everything was insanely cheap. Hope to come back to KL just for this stuff.
0,Paul W.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"Blue Boy Vegetarian is set up like the typical Malaysian kopitiam or hawker centre, with several stalls housed in a shop lot. Each stall focuses on one kind of dish (noodle soups, chee cheong fun, nasi lemak, char koay teow, economy rice, etc.). You order your dish (dishes, let's be honest) from each stall and a drink to go with it (them, let's be honest). I come here several times during every visit to KL. Most of the food here is vegan by default since dairy is very rarely used in Asian cooking.

You only need to request ""no egg"" for the char koay teow (highly recommended dish) to veganise it and you're good to go. Another dish that's not vegan (nor veganisable) is the curry laksa. Very sadly, they add dairy coffee creamer to this traditionally coconut milk-based curry soup for 'extra flavour'.

By now, I've had almost every item on offer and they're all tasty. Some of them, you wouldn't even guess are vegan, particularly the char koay teow, chee cheong fun and nasi lemak.

This is a must-go for every vegan or vegetarian (but go vegan lah!) visiting KL. It's a little off the beaten path, tucked away in a quiet corner, but still easily accessible by MRT (Bukit Bintang) and Grab car.

Okay, my job here is done, you're welcome."
0,Matt B.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"Good veggie place for a cheap meal. I stopped for a light mid-afternoon meal, helped myself to the not-so-fresh food that was remaining, and paid 7 RM. The food is much better at Le Tian, over at the Sungei Wang plaza, so I'd recommend that place instead, but this was still solid."
0,Lucie B.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"When I became a vegetarian, of course I feared that I would no longer be able to enjoy my favorite Malaysian hawker foods.

Thankfully I was introduced to Blue Boy and it is a saving grace.

The food is so good here that you don't even think twice about it being meatless.

The char kway teow is actually one of the best I've had, with a good wok hei and spiciness. Wantan Mee is also delish and the nasi lemak is awesome!

Actually everything here is boss but be careful with the Curry Mee etc as they can be explosively spicy.

All dishes can be made vegan and the staff are friendly and speak English. If you're looking for typical Malaysian fare without the animal products then this is the place!"
0,Annabelle Y.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"Don't expect posh vegetarian dining here, it's as no frills as it can be. This stall is located in a kopitiam type of setting and yes, they only have vegetarian fare here but even if you are not vegetarian, I bet you will enjoy the food here. The whole centre has about over 10 stalls selling the green stuff. Okay, not only just vegetables , they have your standard hawker fare like assam laksa, soup noodles, tom yam, fried rice and so on.

My friend ordered the char kuey teow and it blew his mind. He is a genuine carnivore and he was impressed with the taste as the dish was dry fried and contained egg, which made it very fragrant. I had some of the snacks as I was not feeling too hungry., I love radish cake and the version they have here was to my taste with a generous amount of radish to flour ratio. The cucur prawn is indeed not prawn but soy meat though I felt it was too oily. I dipped them in chili sauce, not too bad after all! The yong tau foo was just decent though I would prefer to eat less soy substitutes.

They do sell economical noodles and mee hoon and the price is very affordable for a quick meal. I will opt for the mixed rice next time as I saw they have a good selection that would do for a substantial meal. Locating this place can be a pain so be sure to ask for proper directions or google it before making your journey here."
0,Stephanie X.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"Hidden in the back alleys of  the old Pudu Road, Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre is a place
you would definitely have to visit & I'm pretty sure you would go back for more!

Similar to your average chinese coffee shops ('kopitiam'), Blue Boy offers a vast variety of your typical chinese hawker food, the only thing is that its purely vegetarian. Dont let this hinder you from paying a visit as I must say that the taste is not compromised!

Here the rice dishes vary on weekdays & follow a standard weekend menu. For example, on weekdays they would serve a variety of dishes for their 'chap fan' & on weekends you would be able to enjoy their bak kut teh, chicken rice & popiah rolls.
However the other stalls offers food items such as  curry laksa, assam laksa, mee jawa, chee cheong fan, vegetarian burgers & fried kuey teow are offereed on a daily basis.

Parking might be a hassle here as the space is pretty tight, however you would be able to park further down the road & take a short stroll up!"
0,Car S.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"No packaged flat rice noodles will ever compare to fresh and this is one place to get it, albeit in another country in Southeast Asia. Chow fun noodles at its best, Vegetarian to boot. Yum!"
0,Amirul R.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"It truly confounds me that this classic hawker court with a twist remains impressively local and hidden after decades! Blue Boy is an all vegetarian food court with an amazing selection of different dishes. Let me try to count them all: economy rice, wantan me, curry mee, ""prawn"" mee, nasi lemak, nasi goreng, burgers, char kway teow. What was that? Vegetarian (and vegan) char kway teow? Yes. Seriously. It's easily top five char kway teow in the country. Believe me!"
0,Ryan Q.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"It's hard to believe that everything prepared at this spotless hawker-style cafe at the base of a backstreet apartment block is vegetarian. Even if you catch the chefs using eggs if you bypass this place, fret not, it's all vegan. Even if they do use real eggs, you can request for eggless dishes if you're vegan like me.

Prices here are also low, as this place is a hawker stall. They sell many dishes here from Chicken Rice to Char Kuey Teow and even mixed rice. Of course, the meat here is all mocked meat. No animal cruelty here, just plant based goodness.

I'd recommend this place if you're into awesome Chinese vegan food without paying the price like you would in those fancy- schmancy restaurants."
0,Grey F.,Blue Boy Vegetarian Food Centre,"vegetarian versions of all the local classic dishes, and dirt cheap. pinch me I must be dreaming."
